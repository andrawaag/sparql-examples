Most of the elements have an ORCID link, which in this case shows the full name Josefa Madrid. However, locating and correcting thousands of elements manually would take months. The plan is then to make a query to extract all these elements, then I should be able to make a script to extract the full names from ORCID, and finally I can update the elements with the full name using QuickStatements. Can anyone help me making a query that locate people with ORCID iD (P496) and where the label has the syntax J. Madrid? --Cavernia (talk) 07:18, 2 September 2019 (UTC) @Cavernia: Here is a query proposal where I also added a column for the number of sitelinks: SELECT ?item ?itemlabel ?ORCID ?sitelinks {

I need a query that allows me to have famous authors from all over the world with their date of birth, death and nationality. I tried using \"remarkable works\" but I didn't know how to filter the result and it inevitably crashes. Thanks! – The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:|?]] ([[User talk:|talk]] • contribs).Here's something that'll get you authors who are listed as the author of most books (on Wikidata) # Find prolific authors i.e. authors who are listed as the author of many books
SELECT DISTINCT ?authorLabel ?birthDate ?deathDate ?nationalityLabel ?bookCount WHERE {
  SELECT ?author ?authorLabel ?birthDate ?deathDate ?nationalityLabel (COUNT(?book) AS ?bookCount) WHERE {
    # expand Q571 to include sub-classes of books for more results
    # but this will mostly increase query time
