 Try it! Note that in both queries a single person may be counted more than once if the person have multiple occupation (P106). Both queries give \"the number of scientists\" per occupation (P106) or field of work (P101) rather than a \"list of individual scientist\". The number of scientist in total is too big to make a list of individuals for all groups, but if you limit the selection to one or a few fields, it can be achieved without a timeout. Here is an example query listing the individual scientists sorted per field of work (P101) and sex or gender (P21) for the two field of work (P101) ecology (Q7150) and gender studies (Q1662673). To get a list for other field of work (P101), please change the VALUES clause of the query: SELECT DISTINCT ?fieldLabel ?genderLabel ?scientistLabel {
  VALUES ?field { wd:Q7150 wd:Q1662673  }   # list of P101 for the selection
  ?scientist wdt:P31 wd:Q5; wdt:P106/wdt:P279* wd:Q901; wdt:P21 ?gender; wdt:P101 ?field .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?scientist wdt:P570 [] }

Moreover, I don't want the system to return the Identifiers.How to query and get the correct results? It would be no problem in itself to write that query, but I wont because it is certain to timeout. There are 397,685 items that are instance of river, even without including instance of subclasses of river. So there would be millions and millions of results if it was possible to run the query. Big rivers like e.g. Danube (Q1653) has 159 labels and over 300 statements after removing the external identifiers. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 09:04, 1 May 2020 (UTC) List of Common movies between 2 actors I would like to get the list of movies in which Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio appear together.Thank you for your help.

 Try it! --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 09:30, 2 May 2020 (UTC) way to search for surnames in labels? Because not every person has a family name (P734) statement, if I want to find everyone with one surname I have to search in labels. The basic query which I found for the purpose is (using the name Beaupre as example):SELECT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE { ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q5 . ?item rdfs:label ?itemLabel . FILTER(CONTAINS (?itemLabel, \"Beaupre\")) }This works but can only do it without timing out if I specify a very restricted set of items to search, such as everything with a certain external identifier; male (Q6581097) is still much too broad. Is there a way of searching all Q5 whatsoever? also, how would you write the string search to only find your match at the end of the label? Levana Taylor (talk) 13:34, 1 May 2020 (UTC) @Levana Taylor: To take the last question first: You can use the function STRENDS instead of CONTAINS to match at end of the label only. However there is no way of searching all labels of persons using the Query Service. There are millions of persons with even more millions of labels, so it is impossible to search all in 60 seconds (the limit for timeout) without restricting the set of items as you describe. You will have to use some other tools (I don't know any which can be used here but they could exit without me knowing them) or analyze a Wikidata database dump. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 14:44, 1 May 2020 (UTC) @Levana Taylor: I thought of a way to do almost do it: You can use Wikidata's MediaWiki API to search labels in a specific language, and do that from SPARQL code. Please wait while I make a query for that. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 15:00, 1 May 2020 (UTC) You still can use family name (P734) Items used: Beaupre (Q4877609)   Properties used: family name (P734)   , has part(s) (P527)   """@en;
