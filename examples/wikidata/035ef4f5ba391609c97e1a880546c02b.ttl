And would you mind helping me fix this one please @Tagishsimon: ? @Anthere: With pleasure. iirc listeria requires its queries to provide a column of ?item values; no other variable name will do. So changing ?occupation to ?item has produced results. I've also removed a column (headed 'label') which was defined, but in such a way that it would never be filled.

Duplicates will arise if there are multiple P31s - but P31 values are not in the select, so a DISTINCT will get rid of them. Duplicates in located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) - and there were some - will also cause duplicate rows; dealt with now using group_concat. Duplicate values in any of the other selected fields would also cause duplicates, but there are none (that I have spotted). The problem with the sort was that it was case-sensitive; now it is case insensitive. hth. #Recherche dans Wikidata les éléments qui sont des archives (ou l'une de ses sous-classes) et qui ont pour pays la Suisse.

 Try it! My goal is to determine if there are any results from the above query that are included in Category:Musicians work group articles needing infoboxes (Q8654948). I will eventually add the Infobox person/Wikidata to those Wikipedia pages resulting in an infobox with those fields present. That's my goal, anyway.Thanks for your time. - Trilotat (talk) 16:52, 7 October 2018 (UTC) @Trilotat: Here is a query which starts to give you what you want, but might need some more work. First, I have to tell you that to get at references for a statement, you need to use p:, ps: prov:wasDerivedFrom, pr: and prv: values, rather than wdt: values. I direct your attention to the data model. On that diagram, if you start at Item you can see that you can get to a simple value using wdt:. But the plumbing is such that if you want the reference, you go down the p: path to a statement, and from there along a prov:wasDerivedFrom path to get a statement concerned with the reference, and from there along either a pr: or prv: path to get a property reference or a property referece value. Fun, huh? And super confusing until it clicks. So in this query I give you two selects. The first is what you're after. The second allows you to see properties/values associated with references. Swap the position of the # to use one or the other. And in short: for P19, reftype19 gets the property type for references, and the three filters exclude reference types we're not interested in - dates, \"imported from\", etc. However: until we either tie down which are valid references (e.g. stated in (P248) and explicitly require them; or tie down all unwanted reference type, and exclude them, the report will not be complete. For instance, take reference URL (P854) - that's probably valid, yes? But, umm, there may be some other reference properties (which I cannot think of) which you'll want to exclude. So. When you get a result you want to exclude, you can run the alternate select, work out the value that needs excluding, and add some more filters, or change the filters. You'll get there. I've used values ?human {wd:Q86701}. to constrain the results to Ernst. @Tagishsimon: Wow; thank you! I think I might be contemplating this for days, but I do hope I will get there. I try to \"reverse engineer\" what you've provided, but I don't know how to remove the values ?human {wd:Q86701}. I might understand it, but I don't know how to remove the code without breaking the query. Trilotat (talk) 20:10, 7 October 2018 (UTC) @Trilotat: So, I think you had a go at removing the values statement, ran the report, and got a timeout. Trouble is, the report is now looking across all 1.7M or however many humans we have; it does not have enough time to do this, and so times out. We only have 60 seconds or so of processor time before WDQS decides our query is rubbish and terminates it. So, the thing to do now is constrain the results, e.g. with reference to a requirement for an occupation (P106) or country of citizenship (P27) value, so that we're interrogating a smaller set of records. I've amended the example, below, to require the ?human to be German and a Lyricist. Now we get some results - and you'll see several rows for some individuals, because they have e.g. more than one occupation. (We could deal with this using group_concat, should we wish). I tried the query with German, Composer, but it timed out. So, the major problem going forwards is to design queries that will work within the timescale, but cover the ground you want covering. I've also added another query, mainly to show these statement things I was talking about - they're basically a URI which is used as a stepping stone from one part of the dataset to another. It might help you find your way. But the data model is your road map. Stare at it until it makes sense :) --Tagishsimon (talk) 20:43, 7 October 2018 (UTC) Come back with follow-up, and we'll probably get there sometime.

 Try it! Last created elements ? Hi,Is it possible to have the last created elements on wikidata with a sparql request ? The last created items of towns, the last created items of mens, the last created items of songs ? And see the result on a timeline ?Thanks. --Touam (talk) 16:07, 30 September 2018 (UTC) Hi, a simple way is to look at the wikielement number. The higher the number, the newest. Bouzinac (talk) 18:39, 30 September 2018 (UTC) Thanks ; and with sparql ? For instance, \"what are the last created items of songs\", since one month (for instance), request with sparql, see the results on a timeline ? --Touam (talk) 08:19, 1 October 2018 (UTC) @Touam: Plain old SPARQL will not give access to revision dates for wikidata records (to the extent of my knowledge). So as Bouzinac says, you can grab sets of records based on their QId, and an example for songs is below. As you cannot get any dates, you cannot have a timeline; just a regular table. And you need to make your own estimate of from which QId number you want the set. My example asks for QIds with numerals greater than 56000000; Vicenç Viaplana (Q56000000) was created 6 August 2018‎ so we're seeing a couple of months of songs. I don't know if there's a better way of approaching the greater-than element of the query below ... it's not very efficient. It is possible that there's an generator (such as revisions) which would allow us to use MWAPI to add revision dates to the query, or select with reference to a date parameter. But I know too little about this area to help; and suspect that there's an insufficient allowance of processing time to make this route useful. SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?items WHERE {
  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q7366.
  bind(xsd:integer(strafter(str(?item),\"Q\")) as ?items) .
  filter(?items>56000000)
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }
} order by ?item
 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 19:38, 1 October 2018 (UTC) OK, thanks @Tagishsimon:. --Touam (talk) 06:19, 8 October 2018 (UTC) Hi, I've tried for men and women, see User:Touam#Hommes et femmes entrées sur wikidata. It's ok for women, but for men it's always a timeout ? --Touam (talk) 08:08, 8 October 2018 (UTC) Monuments with P969 Hi, I wanted to change the adresses of the historic monuments of my region from P969 (P969) to located on street (P669), but I don't seem to be able to add the items with P969 to this querry: SELECT DISTINCT
  ?item
  ?itemLabel
  ?communeLabel
WHERE { {
    SELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {
      ?item wdt:P1435/wdt:P279* wd:Q14469659 .
      ?item p:P1435 ?heritage_statement .
      FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?heritage_statement pq:P582 ?end . }
    } }
  ?item wdt:P131/wdt:P131* wd:Q510572 .
  ?item wdt:P131 ?commune .
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"fr\" . }
}

ORDER BY ?communeLabel ?itemLabel
 Try it! Thanks in advance for you help. --Fralambert (talk) 00:20, 9 October 2018 (UTC) @Fralambert: I'm not sure that's a great idea. Add P669, maybe, but if you remove P969 then you lose the building's street number. Anyway: here's the query. SELECT DISTINCT
  ?item
  ?itemLabel
  ?communeLabel
  ?P969
  ?P669
  ?P669Label
WHERE { {
    SELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {
      ?item wdt:P1435/wdt:P279* wd:Q14469659 .
      ?item p:P1435 ?heritage_statement .
      FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?heritage_statement pq:P582 ?end . }
    } }
  ?item wdt:P131/wdt:P131* wd:Q510572 .
  ?item wdt:P131 ?commune .
  optional {?item wdt:P969 ?P969.}     
  optional {?item wdt:P669 ?P669.}     
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"fr\" . }
}
GROUP BY ?item ?itemLabel ?communeLabel ?P969 ?P669 ?P669Label
ORDER BY ?communeLabel ?itemLabel
 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 00:34, 9 October 2018 (UTC) Mybe I just done a bad formuation. Il wish to replace P969 (P969) by located on street (P669). But first I have to found the items with P969 for create the items for the streets. and the sreet number are not a problem, since I can add house number (P670) as a qualifier. --Fralambert (talk) 00:45, 9 October 2018 (UTC) Ok I have the wanted result here: SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?communeLabel ?P969 WHERE {
  {
    SELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {
      ?item (wdt:P1435/wdt:P279*) wd:Q14469659.
      ?item p:P1435 ?heritage_statement.
      FILTER(NOT EXISTS { ?heritage_statement pq:P582 ?end. })
    }
  }
  ?item (wdt:P131/wdt:P131*) wd:Q510572.
  ?item wdt:P131 ?commune.
  ?item wdt:P969 ?P969. 
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"fr\". }
}
GROUP BY ?item ?itemLabel ?communeLabel ?P969 
ORDER BY ?communeLabel ?itemLabel
 Try it! I think this would be find for me. --Fralambert (talk) 00:49, 9 October 2018 (UTC) Still not clear to me why you would want to remove the perfectly valid information in P969. Adding it to P669 does not require it to be deleted from P969. Your report limits the result set to items with P969, but it would probably be helpful to you to know which items already have P669, which is why I included tho two 669 columns. --Tagishsimon (talk) 00:52, 9 October 2018 (UTC) I may keep P969, it will probably more easy to keep it. But at least P669 have the advantage that I can find all the monuments on a street. --Fralambert (talk) 00:59, 9 October 2018 (UTC) Agreed. P669 is much more report friendly. --Tagishsimon (talk) 01:02, 9 October 2018 (UTC) List of libraries by region Abruzzo is an Italian region composed by 4 provinces; queries searching for libraries in each province are executed in few milliseconds (L'Aquila, Chieti, Pescara e Teramo), but the query for Abruzzo gives a timeout: any hint? Pietro (talk) 07:44, 9 October 2018 (UTC) @ Pietro: No clue, but this route works: SELECT ?item with 
{ select ?item where 
  {
    ?item (wdt:P131/wdt:P131*) wd:Q1284.
   } 
} as %i where
{ 
  include %i
?item (wdt:P31/wdt:P279*) wd:Q7075.
}
 Try it!--Tagishsimon (talk) 09:13, 9 October 2018 (UTC)Tank you @Tagishsimon: have you any advice how to address this issue, potentially affecting other queries? Pietro (talk) 09:27, 9 October 2018 (UTC) Sadly no, beyond where one approach does not work, use another. In this case, using a named subquery worked well. Someone else might have more insight; it does not make a great deal of sense to me that a query looking for an overlap of ~4500 items against ~20000 items times out. --Tagishsimon (talk) 09:32, 9 October 2018 (UTC) We should ask for a \"Wikidata:Request a troubleshoot\" service ;) Pietro (talk) 11:57, 9 October 2018 (UTC) Natural reserves of Colombia Can someone help me to get a list of natural reserves in Colombia?
