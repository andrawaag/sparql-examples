It sounds to me like you created a dublicated item. In that case you have to merge both items that are about the same thing. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 11:12, 1 August 2019 (UTC) Discussing a potential merge I think the items comptroller (Q673633) and controller (Q12306661) should be merged. As far as I can tell, they are both about the occupation, called \"comptroller\" or \"controller\". Some of the links should arguably be in the item auditor (Q10949665) instead. The thing is, I'm not completely certain to what extent these concepts overlap in all of the different languages. Where should I bring this potential merge up for discussion?

Matěj Suchánek (talk) 09:59, 7 August 2019 (UTC) Would it be safe to set the sex or gender (P21) for those 63700 items to male? Items used: human (Q5)   , male given name (Q12308941)   Properties used: instance of (P31)   , given name (P735)   , sex or gender (P21)   select ?item where {

  ?voornaam wdt:P31 wd:Q12308941 .      
  optional {?item wdt:P21 ?geslacht} .
  filter (!bound(?geslacht))} Try it! – The preceding unsigned comment was added by Edoderoo (talk • contribs) at 19:25, 30 July 2019‎ (UTC). It's possible that there would be some errors, since it's not unheard of for females to be given supposedly male given names, including in middle names, and vice versa (e.g., Willy Kanis (Q388542). There are also Wikidata oddities, such as \"Marian\" having different items for \"male\" and \"female\" versions: Marian (Q545486) and Marian (Q20155725). There's no guarantee that the right one will be used: Marian Hedwig Mülberger (Q55906557). Ghouston (talk) 04:09, 31 July 2019 (UTC) I don't think that's a good idea. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 13:53, 31 July 2019 (UTC) Imho it also sounds a bit risky. Given name may not unfrequently shifts gender accross countries or time period (or get mixed up with false friends) and I'm not certain Wikidata currently reflects all theses subtleties. Alexander Doria (talk) 13:59, 31 July 2019 (UTC) Good example of this problem: Maria (Q25413386). - Jmabel (talk) 15:44, 31 July 2019 (UTC) It sound more than \"a bit\" risky, I guess it would possible to cross this with other data to be sure it' actually men? For instance if it's a priest and with a male given name, then it's very likely a man (just to illustrate my point, it's not a very good example, there is only 8 priests in these results) Cdlt, VIGNERON (talk) 19:45, 31 July 2019 (UTC) I actually see exactly the same issues if I fill in the gender by hand, so I should refrain by editing someones gender, until I had a chance to peek into their pants? Another question, why do we register gender, first of all, especially if it is so tricky to fill it in. Edoderoo (talk) 07:42, 1 August 2019 (UTC) There can be references, typically where somebody is referred to with a gendered pronoun. Ghouston (talk) 09:15, 1 August 2019 (UTC) Why would a gendered pronoun be more a more useful reference then the property on the wikidata item of the first name? Edoderoo (talk) 10:16, 1 August 2019 (UTC) Because the gendered pronoun directly implies which gender the person has while first names are in many countries relatively unregulated and contain many expections. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 11:21, 1 August 2019 (UTC) If you look more carefully to the SparQL, you will see that the gender is defined in the linked first name. For the names that have no specific gender, like Mischa (Q18229299) the query has no outcome. For firstnames that can be both male or female, like Marian, there are two wikidata-items. I assume that they are not randomly given to peoples wikidata-item. The above script should not set male to females, unless someone attached a male firstname to a female. Then the error is already there. Edoderoo (talk) 11:29, 1 August 2019 (UTC) I've assumed that \"male given name\" just means the name is usually assigned to males, and there's nothing wrong with using that item for females too. Having two items for the same name would seem silly, because they are the same name after all. Ghouston (talk) 01:53, 2 August 2019 (UTC) Personally I wouldn't name it silly, as it just depends how far do you want to specify a first name. You can easily defend that Maria, Marja, Mara and Marian have the same origin, and are therefor the same first name. About assumptions you are right. My assumption is that we can freely copy the assumed gender from the first name in case it is missing. When entering it manually, we do exactly the same thing after all. Edoderoo (talk) 08:17, 2 August 2019 (UTC) Should we have male and female versions even of \"unisex\" names like Adrian (Q372250)? What would be the advantage? Every name is potentially unisex. I think a better idea would be to change the descriptions \"male given name\" or \"female given name\" to just \"given name\". I was momentarily confused by Adrian (Q372250) because the description in Dutch is \"mannelijke voornaam\", or \"male forename\", so I wondered if there was a female version, but there doesn't seem to be. In cases where there are two versions of a name, we also haven't considered which one to use for people of unknown sex or non-binary sex. Ghouston (talk) 08:52, 2 August 2019 (UTC) @Edoderoo: We register gender because it's information that people care about. It allows automated scripts to find the right pronoun. It always people to answer questions such as \"Which are the 5 biggest cities that are ruled by female majors\" via SPARQL that are hard to answer without Wikidata. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 11:21, 1 August 2019 (UTC) In Sweden we have the tradition that we add the name of the hamlet somebody comes from into the name. Then the name would still be female even if it is used on a male person. (Or the other way around.) IP 62.20.170.74 (Hej!) 09:02, 2 August 2019 (UTC) soweego 1.0 release (Please disregard this message if you have already read it in the Wikidata mailing list, and apologies for the distraction) TL;DR: soweego version 1 is out! https://github.com/Wikidata/soweego Like it?

Matěj Suchánek (talk) 12:19, 8 August 2019 (UTC) Moving statements from one property to another Is there a way to easily move statements from quotation (P1683) to quotation or excerpt (P7081)? The former property should only be used in references to include supporting text from a quotation (and is apparently usable for qualifiers but I'm not sure if that's an appropriate use case), so it would be nice to have something similar to {{Autofix}} for those. Right now there are a few dozen constraint violations which would be resolved by changing to the newer property. Jc86035 (talk) 16:55, 29 July 2019 (UTC) @Pasleim:.--GZWDer (talk) 17:00, 29 July 2019 (UTC) Write mw.loader.load( '//www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=User:Matěj_Suchánek/moveClaim.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript', 'text/javascript' ); // [[User:Matěj Suchánek/moveClaim.js]] to Special:MyPage/common.js. Then reload the property page P1683, and you'll see move/copy buttons on each claim. —MisterSynergy (talk) 17:08, 29 July 2019 (UTC) @MisterSynergy: I already had that installed. Did you copy the wrong JS? The script is only for copying statements between different items, not for changing the property while retaining the statements on the same item. Jc86035 (talk) 17:19, 29 July 2019 (UTC) Oh I see, I misunderstood your request. You don't want to move claims between property pages, you want to move claims in items from one property to another. Yeah, that needs bot code, not a user script. Fortunately, I have such code as well, adapted from Pasleim's version a while ago. If you describe your task in more detail, I can have a look whether I can help you. Pasleim seems to be quite busy offwiki these days. —MisterSynergy (talk) 17:52, 29 July 2019 (UTC) @MisterSynergy: There are only 41 affected items, though I wouldn't really want to replace them all manually. The lexemes should probably be using usage example (P5831) instead, and I think most of the items should be using quotation or excerpt (P7081) (or the statements should be removed). As an example, on Article 1 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (Q712652), I would want the statements to essentially be unchanged except for the property number (the datatypes are the same). Jc86035 (talk) 16:00, 2 August 2019 (UTC) Article 1 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (Q712652) is done per Special:Diff/991089102 (except for the copyright status (P6216) qualifier which is now being suggested). I just need QIDs to perform those moves, and it is fairly simple for me to do that. So if you sort that out, I'd do the moves.

The Commons analogues are c:Template:PD-ineligible and c:Template:PD-shape.

Jc86035 (talk) 17:29, 3 August 2019 (UTC) Common needs these templates to mark files, which could (in theory) be copyrighted, hence the need for the template. I don't think there is a need for something like that here.

Circeus (talk) 20:40, 3 August 2019 (UTC) The other reason, I think, is that if there are two items with the same label and description, it is quite likely that they're duplicates. So the prohibition is a nice reminder to double-check for that -- and if indeed they're not duplicates, the requirement to make the description distinct (to get past the prohibition) also serves to make the description more specific and more useful as a discriminator. —Scs (talk) 13:52, 4 August 2019 (UTC) Movement Strategy online surveys - opportunity to share your thoughts about reworking movement structures Community conversations are an integral part of movement strategy “Wikimedia 2030”.

Can Wikidata be used to store references for Wikipedia? I mean, today a Wikipedia article uses a book as reference. My question is can we make an item on Wikidata for the book and then use the Wikidata item as a reference in an article? Like this, references could be tracked easily, being shared among multiple articles etc.--Kozuch (talk) 11:26, 4 August 2019 (UTC)PS: In Wikimedia_Foundation_Annual_Plan/2018-2019/Final I can see following: \"High quality citations support verifiability. To build a more reliable internet based in facts, we need a more robust network of references on and beyond Wikipedia.\" This may point to using Wikidata for citations.--Kozuch (talk) 11:30, 4 August 2019 (UTC) Wikidata stores most of the fields needed for w:Template:Citation. I think there is some development ongoing to store it more systematically (cite extension?). Also, Wikidata stores references for specific statements that can be displayed on Wikipedia (e.g. date of birth). Not that this is really new. --- Jura 11:43, 4 August 2019 (UTC) That is a very interesting topic that you have brought up and will most likely be a hot topic for Wikidata in the time yet to come. I think that Wikidata Bridge will be the project to really make this change come alive, and connect Wikidata and Wikipedia like Wikipedia and Commons are linked today. If you are looking for an existing way of using Wikidata entries with w:Template:Citation. Will I recommend using w:Template:Wikidata. - Premeditated (talk) 13:25, 4 August 2019 (UTC) I don't quite see the relation, but w:Template:Cite Q might be closer to what Kozuch has in mind. --- Jura 13:33, 4 August 2019 (UTC) Cite Q documentation has the following warning at the beginning: Warning: From the TfD closure: \"[...] works-in-progress should rarely be used in the article space until they are 99% finished/accurate/etc. Until the matter of transcluding Wikidata on Wikipedia is resolved (most likely with a huge and contentious RFC) usage of this template should be extremely vetted to ensure that all of the transcluded information is accurate.\" – The preceding unsigned comment was added by Jc3s5h (talk • contribs). Well that's just enwiki and it's not even red there. Other Wikipedias might not require their volunteers to re-copy references for each statement. --- Jura 17:38, 4 August 2019 (UTC) Comment When you talk about making a Wikidata item for a book, you need to be careful, because a book (in Wikidata terms) should never be cited. A \"book\" can mean a particular work, or a particular edition of that work, or a particular physical copy of that edition. For that reason Wikiproject:Books has rejected the use of book (Q571). Instead you should cite an edition of a book. In other words, you need one data item for the work and another data item for the edition (specific year, specific publisher, specific ISBN, etc.), and you should cite that edition of the work. Different editions will have different publication details, possibly different page numbers, and even different text, so it is important to cite the particular edition used as a source. --EncycloPetey (talk) 21:03, 4 August 2019 (UTC) Checking if a concept exist in Wikidata  In Dutch there is the railway term 'wisselstraat' for a combination of Double slips (Q14905968) crossing diagonaly the other tracks. In de Commons:Category:Railway points in Belgium there are many examples of this. Is there a Wikidata item for this? It is a combination of Q14905968. In Dutch there is only a redirect nl:Wisselstraat (spoorweg) is 'wisselstraat' kan also be a ordinary streetname. ('straat' is 'street' in English) As in Wisselstraat (Q29939452).Smiley.toerist (talk) 12:47, 31 July 2019 (UTC) @Smiley.toerist: If you're referring to the concept of multiple double slips one after the other (as in the photo), I don't think this concept exists in most languages so it's probably safe to assume that a Wikidata item doesn't exist. If there isn't an existing sitelink then I probably wouldn't create an item for it, although I guess you could create a lexeme for \" wisselstraat \" and then link a new item for the concept to the lexeme.

As you may know, churches, chapels and altars are named after a saint or another religious figure (God, Trinity), which is called \"titular [saint]\"; for example, the titular of a \"Saint Paul church\" is saint Paul. As far as I know, currently there are two properties used for it, property:P825 (\"dedicated to\") and property:P138 (\"named after\"); both are somehow correct, but a new \"titular\" property would be far more appropriate.

Date of confession Location of confession Date of arrest marital status - assume we would just link to spouses, children, siblings, relatives using those existing properties? However, this is sparse. accused of - there is rich information in terms of the different things the accused witches are actually accused of e.g. devil's mark, shapechanging (to a cat, a dog, a hare, an apparition). Ordeal type - technically distinct from the extrajudicial torture that took place although many ordeals involved painful procedures, this was a test conducted in order to let nature or God reveal the truth. Values would include: Bierricht (corpse bleeds), Ducking (otherwise known as the water test, Pricking (the body of the suspect witch was pricked with pins in order to find a Devil’s mark). I imagine we could characterise under manner of torture/punishment if having a separate property for ordeal proved inappropriate. Although this test would have formed part of the trial process. Ordeal date. Cause of malice - why the accused witches were accused of acting as they did (values such as revenge, debt, slander, grudge, failed business). Could Has Cause (P828) be used here? It is more of an accusation/complaint than a direct cause though. Any thoughts on how these could work? Stinglehammer (talk) 11:15, 23 July 2019 (UTC) @Stinglehammer: Try to use as much as possible significant event (P793):this reduces the need of specialized properties. Ex: significant event (P793):confession by suspect (Q1219996) point in time (P585):XX.XX.XXXX Or significant event (P793):arrest (Q1403016) point in time (P585):XX.XX.XXXX location (P276):Y Snipre (talk) 22:30, 23 July 2019 (UTC) @Stinglehammer: There is the property convicted of (P1399) too. Snipre (talk) 06:48, 24 July 2019 (UTC) Many thanks Snipre, this is very useful and a good workaround which encompasses much of what we're looking to achieve. We had planned on using significant event (P793) to link the accused witch to the item on their witch trial. I would just question how useful it is to have confession, arrest, trial and more all under the significant event (P793) umbrella from a modelling and querying point of view. If the general consensus is this is best practice then can certainly import with that method in mind. Any thoughts on the other property types I mentioned? Stinglehammer (talk) 11:45, 24 July 2019 (UTC) I think an \"accused of\" property could be valuable and even extend easily to modern persons/companies (where Wikidata item of this property (P1629) is accused (Q28056401)). The \"cause of malice\" should probably be specified as a qualifier of some sort, but I'm unsure what's best. I think all of the \"date of\" and \"location of\" can be done using significant event (P793). --SilentSpike (talk) 08:45, 29 July 2019 (UTC) Can definitely look to put forward a property proposal for accused of if this would be useful elsewhere too. We've been working with adding date and location information via the significant event (P793) property as suggested above for confessions etc. One thing to note is that we have items of data for each instance of Scottish witch trial with trial dates now added. However the database also includes case dates whereby the case denotes the whole period of investigation the accused witch is subjected to so it could cover a ten year period with one or more or multiple instances of witch trials in this period. Therefore we were wondering whether significant event (P793) could be used again with a new item created for witchcraft investigation/investigated for witchcraft and then dates added as qualifiers. OR whether we might need to create a new item for EACH case and then have those link to the trials.e.g. Case of Isobel Gowdie. Thoughts on this would be welcome. Stinglehammer (talk) 14:58, 31 July 2019 (UTC) Since so many of these properties involve dates, I should interject that I have emailed Prof. Julian Goodare, one of the editors of the database. The dates in the database use the calendar that was in effect at the time and place of the event described, which is nearly always the Julian calendar, since England and Scotland didn't convert to Gregorian until 14 September 1752. Also, Scotland considered the year to begin on 25 March until 1600, and England did the same until 1752, but the database always treats 1 January as the first day of the year. So dates from the database should be mapped to proleptic Julian calendar (Q1985786), not proleptic Gregorian calendar (Q1985727). Jc3s5h (talk) 14:04, 2 August 2019 (UTC) Many thanks Jc3s5h, Prof Julian Goodare is aware of the project and meeting with us next week to discuss the work to date with a view to quality assuring. The dates seem to have defaulted to Gregorian on import so we are making changes accordingly. We now have items of data for (1) accused witches in the database (biographical, geographical data added) and these are linked to (2) the witch trials they underwent and (3) the people associated with those witch trials (sherriffs, lairds, judges etc.). Returning to my other question, we also have dates of 'cases' which are defined as \"The witchcraft case follows the series of events and specific accusations that emerged from a denunciation of a person accused for witchcraft that was pursued by either ecclesiastical and/or civil authorities. The case encompasses the beginning (i.e. initial denunciation or supposed denunciation), middle (i.e. the investigation, arrest and trial of an accused witch), and end (i.e. the way the case ended in dropped charges, a verdict of innocence, or execution) of a witchcraft accusation. The ‘case’ does not only refer to a trial or trial process but also includes references to cultural beliefs about witchcraft practice that were found in the documents. It should also be pointed out that ‘case’ refers to one individual who was accused of witchcraft. The term does not refer to a series of trials in a large witch-hunt.\" e.g. .e.g. Case of Isobel Gowdie - would it be appropriate to have this modelled as significant event (P793) and linked to a newly created item for 'investigated for witchcraft which would be an instance of inquiry (Q21004260) and/or a subclass of hunt of the witches (Q188494) as a way of including the dates of the case/period of investigation? We have case dates for almost all 3,219 accused witches but trial dates for only 600 so modelling case dates would be very useful for querying/visualising purposes. Thoughts welcome on this. Stinglehammer (talk) 15:40, 6 August 2019 (UTC) New data type for EntitySchemas Hello all,Based on community request, a new data type is about to be created, in order to link to Schemas from statements. You can already have a look at it on Beta (a test property has been created). The value type is string, so you will enter for example \"E1\" as a value.You can learn more in the ticket. This data type will be available on August 7th. Cheers, Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 15:01, 5 August 2019 (UTC) Thanks, but why string? Wouldn't it have been wiser to make them entities just as items, properties, and lexemes? One could search for EntitySchemas by label, instead of having to type the E-ID. Use in WDQS would have been more comfortable. It would create backlinks. That would make it easier to validate all statements with this data type via the pagelinks table at any time. Now the value is apparently validated during input (i.e. needs to start with \"E\" and then followed by numbers; E-ID needs to exist). However, if the EntitySchema is deleted or merged, it will be difficult to update this in statements. Even more in general if everything goes smoothly, it would be interesting to easily find items which link to an EntitySchema. --MisterSynergy (talk) 15:40, 5 August 2019 (UTC) @MisterSynergy: With this datatype, it should be possible to unlock Wikidata:Property proposal/Shape Expression for class, that in turn will allow us to write human (Q5) : Shape Expression for class = E10 Presumably this will then add a line wd:Q5 wdt:Pxxx wd:E10 to WDQS (though @Lea Lacroix (WMDE): it would be good to confirm that this will indeed be the case). You're right that, regarding backlinks, there does appear to be a problem -- eg https://wikidata.beta.wmflabs.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/EntitySchema:E1 shows nothing, whereas it ought to show https://wikidata.beta.wmflabs.org/wiki/Property:P253078 as linking there. Jheald (talk) 19:05, 5 August 2019 (UTC) In WDQS it will look like wd:Q5 wdt:Pxxx 'E10'. Those are strings, not IRIs, pretty much as with Commons category (P373). —MisterSynergy (talk) 19:15, 5 August 2019 (UTC) Well that would just be a complete pain. I have added comment phab:T214884#5394245 to the Phabricator thread, that the datatype is not ready to go if this is what would be the case. EntitySchema-valued properties ought to work in exactly the same way as Lexeme-valued properties, as per eg this query: https://w.wiki/6pT Jheald (talk) 19:32, 5 August 2019 (UTC) Hello all,Thanks for your quick feedback. It seems that we have indeed more things to discuss and to investigate here, in order to find more sustainable solutions. I don't have a precise date but since part of the team will be busy with Wikimania, it will be postponed at least to the end of August. Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 07:36, 6 August 2019 (UTC) Thanks, glad to read this. Some additional thoughts: if you make EntitySchemas entities rather than string, ... ... they would come with a canonical URI (which we don't have yet, but ShEx validation needs this as well to reliably resolve relative URIs to absolute ones); see phab:T225778 ... their labels etc. could be incorporated in WDQS ... the actual ShEx code could be linked in WDQS as well, e.g. wd:E10 foo:shex <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntitySchemaText/E10> (with foo:shex being some quickly invented placeholder here, as I am not sure which predicate one would really want to use). We do something similar with images which are not by themselves in WDQS, but there are links to image files at Commons via wdt:P18 --MisterSynergy (talk) 08:02, 6 August 2019 (UTC) New gadget: related items Wikidata is a strongly interlinked database with many items having ingoing and outgoing links. Unfortunately, the user interface does not display any ingoing links ('inverse properties').

At the moment, I believe Wikidata downloads the entire company name from the GRID Database for entities, e.g. https://grid.ac/institutes/grid.450423.4#, which may cause some confusion with international brands, institutes, etc. and also multiply entries unnecessarily, e.g. https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30294921 and https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q55316619.

For example I added Gangneung (Q42056) the Korean (Hangul), but how can I add the Hanja, the Revised Romanization, and McCune–Reischauer Romanization? It seems that the language option for native label (P1705) was for the language, while I think it should be for the writing system instead. Bennylin (talk) 04:30, 10 August 2019 (UTC) Transliterations generally have a specific property than can be added as a qualifier of the native label, e.g. McCune-Reischauer romanization (P1942). --- Jura 11:27, 10 August 2019 (UTC) I hope this is correct [17] Bennylin (talk) 19:25, 17 August 2019 (UTC) Merging two items Hi all, I have done some merges before, but always with a degree of worry!

Perhaps it would be better to add the Javanese-script name as a statement, but I'm not sure how this would work (maybe you could add writing system (P282) as a qualifier to a official name (P1448)/native label (P1705) statement).

See the sandbox. Note than only a few external identifiers do have a short name (P1813) defined, se this list, but you can try to add some more short names for identifiers with very long labels.

In a case like the above I don't see how it's important to know why the item was protected to move the link.

It's a tradeoff. We had an RfC about whether we want to protect high use items and found a community consensus whether or not you like the consensus that was found.

So users like me end up having to deal with the fall out. --- Jura 16:05, 13 August 2019 (UTC) Abian seem to think that all of those 3000 most used items have >500 references.

ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 16:50, 13 August 2019 (UTC) New proposed data model: Post-conviction relief I'd like to propose a new data model, but I can't find a relevant WikiProject through which to propose it. It would include a bunch of new properties. This is an extension of my proposal to add an \"exonerated of\" property. The purpose of this proposal is to better represent the complexity of legal systems, especially the ways in which a person may be found to be innocent (exoneration) or less culpable (commutation) after an initial conviction. (If there's a better place to start this conversation, please let me know.)Data Model for \"Post-Conviction Relief\"What is it: the category of legal actions taken after someone is convicted of a crime that can lead to reduced or eliminated sentences. This model covers pardons, exonerations, and commutations. In general, I propose that these be represented by pairs of properties -- one would be a \"post-conviction relief applied\" qualifier to the \"convicted of\" property, and the other would be a standalone property in its own right (\"exonerated of\", \"pardoned of\", \"received commutation for\") New qualifier Convicted of: <crime> Point in time Etc… NEW: Post-conviction relief applied: <pardon|exoneration|commutation> -- constraint: must have corresponding property, e.g.: exonerated of New properties Exonerated of: <crime> property constraint (P2302): must also have convicted of same crime; convicted of that crime should be deprecated (not sure how to represent that) citation-needed constraint (Q54554025) Value type constraint (same as crime) Type constraint (same as crime) Allowed qualifiers: point in time (P585) court (P4884) has cause (P828) Mandatory qualifier constraint: point in time (P585) Pardoned of: (same properties as Exonerated of), except: may not require deprecating the conviction qualifier: remove court, replace with an officeholder of some sort? (In the US it’s governor or president; I’m sure it’s different elsewhere) Received Commutation for: <crime> property constraint (P2302): must also have convicted of same crime citation-needed constraint (Q54554025) Value type constraint (same as crime) Type constraint (same as crime) Allowed qualifiers: point in time (P585) court (P4884) has cause (P828) (There should be a way to represent the fact that this may result in someone receiving early relief from their sentence, but not necessarily at the same point in time as their commutation – you could appeal a 10 year sentence, get 5 instead, and still have to serve out a few years before the commutation takes effect) Mandatory qualifier constraint: point in time (P585) -Kenirwin (talk) 20:03, 12 August 2019 (UTC) The model here is that you normally are commuted after 2/3 of the time.

(700+ items) Similarly for The Simpsons (Q886) where it has about 600+ items.But for a smaller show like Suits (Q370185), even when at least some episodes are on some language wikipedia, there are no records found.I think for the sake of consistency, it makes most sense that to modify the inclusion criterion to something along the lines of If one item of television series episode (Q21191270) is on Wikidata, all members of the same series should/could be created. That creates completeness, rather than half data for series that are not quite as popular but still popular enough to warrant some Wikidata entries. And I believe on Wikidata we should strive towards complete data as much as possibleSoni (talk) 20:41, 7 August 2019 (UTC) Where is this inclusion criteria that you would have amended? Wikidata:Notability/Inclusion criteria is not it. Can't find it within Wikidata:WikiProject Movies. Nor is it covered AFAICS at Wikidata:Notability; but that page makes the point that items are notable if they meet some structural need, which episodes of a series surely do. As to the proposed change: should is inappropriate for an inclusion criteria, in the sense that the criteria for item A should not be 'oh go on then, create also items B - Z'. Could is appropriate for an inclusion criteria, but the structural need notability criteria seems to have that angle covered already? --Tagishsimon (talk) 21:00, 7 August 2019 (UTC) If not all episodes of \"Suits\" are here it's just that nobody bothered including them. --- Jura 21:04, 7 August 2019 (UTC) With the current standards there's nothing stopping someone from creating items for all episodes of Suits. We don't need to change any policy for this case. There might be cases where a YouTube user has a \"TV series\" with 1000 episodes and one of those episodes is a source for a Wikidata claim. In a case like that I woulnd't want a policy statement that says we automatically should add items for all the episodes. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 07:12, 8 August 2019 (UTC) This.

He explained his reason here. I would rather see a preferred rank bank in this property. Is it the right way to record the population that way? Many features rely on the preferred status. Now you can see the strange effect in the infoboxes here: voy:de:Heilbronn and here: commons:Category:Heilbronn. If somebody wants to look for the most recent entry he can run through the result set of getAllStatements without being interferred by a possible prefferred rank, right? And besides, the bot PreferentialBot will put the rank back, if I understand it right. -- DerFussi 05:13, 9 August 2019 (UTC) It is a result of a discussion on cswiki (w:cs:Wikipedie:Pod_lípou_(technika)#Počet_obyvatel_z_Wikidat), as for some municipalities 30+ years old data were marked as preferred. Removal of preferred rank for most recent data seems to be error in script to me. Anyway, PreferentialBot will fix all soon. Not limiting P1082 output is more likely design flaw of the template.--Jklamo (talk) 08:57, 9 August 2019 (UTC) Maybe the edit summary should explain that (after an onwiki discussion). It's a feature (or known problem) that PreferentialBot doesn't adjust preferred ranks once new data is added.

I agree, it's our local design flaw, that we are dependent only on a preferred rank not on a fresh date mark. Because of that infoboxes rendering whole list of population values or throw template argument size error. I notified our lua guys about it, but for this time they did not solve a problem.

The principle of that 2 phases RfC is to avoid to start the decision before having input from a large number of contributors mentioning particular cases which can change the original proposition. This is always frustrating to give its opinion about a proposition which changes several times between the start and the end of the decision phase.Please have a look at Wikidata:Requests for comment/Improved model for document description.

After this date, you will find the \"Wikidata item\" link in the \"In other projects\" section.In some cases, for example on help and meta pages, the section may contain two links to Wikidata, for example on en:Help:Contents where there will be the \"Wikidata\" link (linking to d:Help:Contents) and the \"Wikidata item\" link (linking to d:Q914807).If you want to know more about the previous discussions or mention a bug or an issue, please add a comment to the related Phabricator task.Thanks for your understanding, Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 09:45, 8 August 2019 (UTC) Can you hold implementing this until the problem discussed at Wikidata:Contact_the_development_team#phabricator:T66315 is resolved? --- Jura 11:24, 8 August 2019 (UTC) The solution of having a \"Wikidata\" and a \"Wikidata item\" link in cases were seems to me like a good solution to the problem. I think it's helpful to list is in the list that way to introduce us as being a proper site in the Wikimedia ecosystem. I can't see of a reason why it would make the enwiki people mad, so I'm in favor.

Calliopejen1 (talk) 01:05, 15 August 2019 (UTC) subject named as (P1810) Should I recognise original CAPITALICS from source or nOt? Eurohunter (talk) 09:55, 4 August 2019 (UTC) What are \"CAPITALICS\"? Capital letters? Italics? Specifically capitals in italics? Something else? Is it a word always written entirely in uppercase? - Jmabel (talk) 16:13, 4 August 2019 (UTC) @Jmabel: Yes just capital letters (schould be included or not). \"Is it a word always written entirely in uppercase\" - no there is no reason for it but capital letters are used sometimes in the titles of articles or for marketing purposes and question is if we should recognise it (original records) or not. Eurohunter (talk) 20:33, 9 August 2019 (UTC) To my knowledge there is no definite rule regarding capitalization. I personally prefer to \"normalize\" all-capital letter strings to a more readable form, and it depends on the language what this exactly means. Mind that quite often names are only *displayed* with capitals only, but not stored in that form in the source. —MisterSynergy (talk) 20:40, 9 August 2019 (UTC) @MisterSynergy: How to know how they are stored? What if capital letters are needed in some cases to destinglish one name from another and not in the others in one item? Eurohunter (talk) 17:53, 15 August 2019 (UTC) You know how they are stored if you get them from a web page that is using an HTML small caps style via font-variant (or a now-deprecated tag), but the underlying content uses lowercase or mixed case. - Jmabel (talk) 23:40, 15 August 2019 (UTC) @Eurohunter: I think that P1810 is not used \"to destinglish one name from another\". It's not a search string, but information about the subject. My interpretion is that the format is free, as already mentioned, but the intention for this property is to be accurate rather than to align with Wikipedia naming standards. If a list is in all caps I would probably normalize it, but if particular names are stylized, such as \"A$AP Rocky\", I would keep that format in P1810. The main use is probably not to show formatting, but to indicate where he's known as \"Rakim\" or some other \"alias\". Biggest missing feature I mentioned it few times already but it's the most important missing and basic feature of Wikidata.

ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 11:08, 10 August 2019 (UTC) @ChristianKl: I think Eurohunter's use case is specifically that he adds labels in all (or most) Latin-script languages at the same time, since this is possible/appropriate for items for which the label doesn't need to be translated. Using \"All entered languages\" doesn't work for items where this is necessary, since there has to be data for a language to be included in that list (if not indicated in the user's Babel boxes). Jc86035 (talk) 11:18, 10 August 2019 (UTC) It seems to me like it would be a lot better to have a mul-Latn fallback language then to have a feature that allows you to list the 40 languages that use latin labels for that problem.

If it's the wrong thing to do I'm happy to stop the practise, but some kind of timestamp seems useful to me. Moebeus (talk) 12:49, 11 August 2019 (UTC) What is this edit meant to mean?

Minerva97 (talk) 18:08, 12 August 2019 (UTC) There is also second family name in Spanish name (P1950), if applicable, although I don't know how different Portuguese and Spanish naming customs are. -Animalparty (talk) 04:45, 13 August 2019 (UTC) In Spanish custom, the mother's family name always comes after the father's, though, which seems not to be the case here. - Jmabel (talk) 06:14, 13 August 2019 (UTC) Portuguese naming is opposite of Spanish: given name/mother's lname/father's lname (Spanish is given name/father's lname/mother's lname). So while Spanish people might omit the second last name, the Portuguese will typically omit the first last name. Scandinavian middle names are typically the same as the Portuguese \"mother's last name\".. 🤷‍♂️ Moebeus (talk) 23:33, 14 August 2019 (UTC) So it sounds more like Scandinavian middle family name (P6978) than second family name in Spanish name (P1950); either the latter should be renamed (in English) to not be specific to Scandinavia, or we should have another property just like Scandinavian middle family name (P6978) for Portuguese usage. - Jmabel (talk) 23:44, 15 August 2019 (UTC) What to do when two items share the same identifier Hello, I was wondering what should be done when two items share the same identifier (with the property having a distinct value constraint)? This relates to UEFA player ID (P2276) as part of UEFA's player database. UEFA currently have a mistake with the following people who have the same name: Maarten Stekelenburg Marten Stekelenburg (Q182685) (born 1982) (also has the UEFA ID 250080520, but it's not too uncommon for one player having two IDs, see Kenan Kodro (Q17612521) for example: [20] [21]) Maarten Stekelenburg (Q2292423) (born 1972) Both share the UEFA ID 150004543 (evidenced by the profile having a 1972 date of birth but showing other team information regarding the player born in 1982) Goran Bogdanović Goran Bogdanovic (Q52880296) (born 1990) Goran Bogdanović (Q3773444) (born 1967) Both share the UEFA ID 250001785 (evidenced by the profile having the date of birth of the 1967 player and his clubs, while showing the Macedonia U-21 youth team appearances of the player born in 1990) I would think both items should have the identifier. Is there a way this can be marked so the statements are not listed as having an 'issue'? Otherwise the identifier will continue to be removed from either one of the items. Thanks, S.A. Julio (talk) 05:19, 15 August 2019 (UTC) An adhoc way of marking it would be to add a together with (P1706) qualifier and link the other item. Ghouston (talk) 06:51, 15 August 2019 (UTC) What about identifier shared with (P4070)? It seems a little more accurate. Nomen ad hoc (talk) 06:59, 15 August 2019 (UTC). Ideal. Ghouston (talk) 07:18, 15 August 2019 (UTC) Great thanks, just what I was looking for! S.A. Julio (talk) 08:33, 15 August 2019 (UTC) The distinct values constraint is an issue that should pop-up a constraint. If the people at UEFA know that two people share one ID, they can fix the error on their website. Having the constraint means that it's easy to see the times the unique value constraint was violated at https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Database_reports/Constraint_violations/P2276. When I'm looking at the list I'm not sure that a single value constraint is appropriate. It seems to me that Ermin Bičakčić (Q75993) has two values by virtue of being in the tournament both in 2016 and 2020 and that looks like it's intentional. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 11:27, 15 August 2019 (UTC) @ChristianKl: I don't think it is intentional, UEFA use the same player ID for people in their match reports throughout their careers, except in these few instances. With the Ermin Bičakčić (Q75993) example, you can see the top bar of UEFA's website appears a bit different in the two links. This is because UEFA keeps a \"cache\" of player profiles to display. Occasionally the UEFA ID of a player will be changed, as in this case. While both links appear to be valid, the reason is a bit clearer looking at UEFA's competition database: the ID 250025190 is now invalid, and has been replaced by 250008197. However, because UEFA keeps this \"cache\" page, the profile of the invalid ID still is accessible on their site. S.A.

However, there are a few hurdles I've encountered in the creation of source items which I'm only just now starting to understand.I think to help others like myself and even just as a reference for the more experienced, it could be very valuable to establish some showcase source items (à la Wikidata:Showcase_items). Ideally, an item for each imaginable type of source (i.e. a book with multiple edition items; a periodical with multiple volume, issue and even article items; an e-book; an audio book, etc.) and an example of their use as a source. Perhaps it's best to create a separate area for this purpose for discoverability and since there's a slightly different priority to the item showcase.Would anyone else be interested in something like this? We could set up a WikiProject and establish some goals. Admittedly I still have a few questions regarding source items, but part of the motivation here is to have those answered with future reference available. --SilentSpike (talk) 13:59, 15 August 2019 (UTC) Support This sounds like a good idea to me!

Basically I'd like to have some discover-able resource of different types of source items and their use that people can refer to if they need to create new such items to add as sources to statements. See the question I link to in my original post for an example of a situation where I have been unable to identify the correct source structuring in practise --SilentSpike (talk) 21:13, 15 August 2019 (UTC) Support; I assume that it would be useful for the newbies (I remember that for me, it was hard to learn how to add a citation). Nomen ad hoc (talk) 18:47, 15 August 2019 (UTC). Oppose I would prefer to improve Help:sources first before starting to spread the information over several pages. People don't have the time to read to read several pages to find the information they are looking for and for me showcases can't provide a rule: there are always plenty of special cases and a showcase can't provide a good overview of what is important to respect. Snipre (talk) 20:04, 15 August 2019 (UTC) I agree, especially when it comes to Help:Sources/Items not needing sources. --Succu (talk) 20:27, 15 August 2019 (UTC) You raise a good point and updating the help pages could also be a priority for a WikiProject in this vein. I personally find it easy to learn from examples which is why I think it's valuable to have items for reference somewhere too (no need to do only one or the other). If we create a WikiProject we could even just use that as the repository of example items and include a link to the project from the help pages with the suggestion that sourcing questions be directed there. Any questions that do come up can be clarified on the help page and we can make sure an example is present that covers the situation (like testing in a development environment, you encounter an issue, you write a test for it so that future instances are caught). --SilentSpike (talk) 21:13, 15 August 2019 (UTC) @SilentSpike: The definition of a data model is often an iterative process with improvement of the initial model with the study of special cases which can't be covered by the inital formulation of the model. And this is why showcase can't be a good way to represent all particular details requiring additional properties/qualifiers. Often showcases represents the simple case in an item category (perhaps 80% of all items) and then to cover the remaining 20%, you need 2-4 additional showcases. So at the end you don't have 1 showcase by category but 3-5 showcases. And without any explanation describing what are the differences between the showcases: people have to analyze the difference shocases to understand what is the characteristics of each item and then establish themselves the general rule leading to the different models. Finally, do we really need a new Wikiproject for that ? Currently, when people have problem with describing sources they use the talk's page of Help:Sources. From my experience of Wikiproject, very few persons are involved in Wikiproject and it is difficult for someone from outside WD to find the correct Wikiproject where to present the problem. Most problems are solved directly in the Project Chat but then we lose the solution when the discussion is archived. My recommandation is to use Help:Sources as place for discussion and data model presentation.

Work in progress : a gadget to visualize class trees and subclass-of paths between two classes Motivation : there is often problems with parent classes of some items − see for example the section #How a human becomes faultly an artificial entity above. It’s then useful to visualise the superclasses of a class to see which other classes their instances are also instances of.So I created a gadget that allows to embed the graph visualisation of WDQS in a Wikidata item page. If a weird superclass is foundUser:TomT0m/classification.jsThe few next steps : add translations in other languages Done translation possible, translated if french 15:07, 16 August 2019 (UTC) add a feature, for items who are instances of some class, to show to the user some of the other class he his instance of to spot some weird stuff, to help finding bugs in the class tree. For example if « Albert Einstein is an Abstract object » is shown this should raise suspicions. Maybe add a button to leave a message with the oddity on some page for other people to try to correct the bug. Done 15:07, 16 August 2019 (UTC) also Done, the ability to report a « bug » in the class tree, if it occurs something weird, such as human becoming an instance of law or something like that. 15:14, 16 August 2019 (UTC) TODO: Other idea : show the metaclass (for example if an item is an instance of a class that is itself an instance of « car model », show that its class is a car model. 15:07, 16 August 2019 (UTC) See if there is other ideas/suggestions/bugs after this post :) author TomT0m / talk page 15:03, 10 August 2019 (UTC) well this proves what I knew - “clothing” upper tree is a mess. (“Headdress” is an “economic sector”?) - PKM (talk) 22:30, 10 August 2019 (UTC) Thanks so much! I've been unrolling the instance of (P31) hierarchy mainly using SPARQL but this is so much more convenient. :) ElanHR (talk) 06:08, 11 August 2019 (UTC) @TomT0m: You can also do this using {{Item documentation}} on talk pages, if I'm interpreting the purpose of the user script correctly. Jc86035 (talk) 11:48, 11 August 2019 (UTC) @Jc86035: I know I'm a contributor to this template :) I added the template to the talk page quite a few times. But it's less flexible, we need to go to the talk page, add the template if it's missing, and there is no dynamic abilities such as showing the subclass chain between the class and one of it's parent (useful if the class tree is missing). author TomT0m / talk page 12:02, 11 August 2019 (UTC) Making progresses I made progresses and implemented something for showing the classes an item is an instance of on a sandbox for this gadget User:TomT0m/classification/sandbox.js. It’s now possible to report weird instances to WikiProject Ontology by clicking a link of the gadget, resulting in [22] this kind of messages. (the weirdness comes from the fact that this item is labelled « heterotroph » in english and in french it’s more like « heterotrophia », which is a process)author TomT0m / talk page 17:10, 12 August 2019 (UTC) Researcher and scientific articles Trygve Ottersen (Q66424846) is a researcher and have published notable work (P800) A Typology of Scientific Advisory Committees (Q56797691) as author (P50) and other works as contributor to the creative work or subject (P767). Is it wanted that all (about 40 https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?search=trygve+ottersen&title=Special:Search&fulltext=1&ns0=1&ns120=1 ) Works and \"co-Works\" shall be listed as notable work (P800) for this person? Pmt (talk) 19:18, 15 August 2019 (UTC) No IMHO; only the notable ones. Nomen ad hoc (talk) 19:45, 15 August 2019 (UTC). +1 to only listing notable ones. If someone wants all works by a person they can query the opposite direction and look for all items that have this person as author (P50). ElanHR (talk) 20:33, 15 August 2019 (UTC) notable work (P800) includes some POV and needs a good reference. --Succu (talk) 20:39, 15 August 2019 (UTC) They can be shown through \"Derived statements\" too ;). Nomen ad hoc (talk) 20:44, 15 August 2019 (UTC). @Nomen ad hoc: Do you refer to inferred from (P3452)? --Succu (talk) 21:11, 15 August 2019 (UTC) No; I speak about the \"Relateditems\" tool, that you can activate on your preferences, and which displays reverse properties at the bottom of any item. Nomen ad hoc (talk) 21:16, 15 August 2019 (UTC). OK, you have a conflict. How dose the gadged resovlse this? --Succu (talk) 21:35, 15 August 2019 (UTC) I have no conflict... I only reverted a claim that seems inaccurate (notability of Q56797691 is not proven). Nomen ad hoc (talk) 21:41, 15 August 2019 (UTC). @Nomen ad hoc:, @Succu: and @ElanHR:. I do think the same as you they should not be listed for the researcher, and have had an answer. @ElanHR: Mainly such scientific articles do not have author (P50) , only author name string (P2093) so there is no \"connection\" to Trygve Ottersen (Q66424846) as author (P50) just author name string (P2093) as Trygve Ottersen. @Nomen ad hoc: You are reverting my edit by asking me, to what extent exactly it is notable? together With your comment No IMHO, only the notable ones. I can only answer to what extent exactly it is NOT notable? Being a scientific article, published in a well known scientific Magazine. Probably evaluated by other fellows. Recogniced for a publication by a Publishing commity. The main thing is shall all the scientific articles be listed as notable work (P800) for a researcher. Probably not. But there must be a better argument for not listen the article than just some dull not notable and at the same time the articles must be connected or related to the Author in some way. And I can not see that author name string (P2093) will cover this as long as it is a text string. The same for short name (P1813). Queries may be ok, but for daily use thay may be to \"Heavy\" I am just asking Pmt (talk) 23:57, 15 August 2019 (UTC) Hi. I've replaced all claims of Ottersen as author name string (P2093) by author (P50) ones. Pmt, just publish a work in a well-know journal doesn't make it notable; it should have been cited (\"evaluated by other fellows\", in your words) a certain number of times, for instance, or, say, have received an award. So the burden of the proof of its \"notability\" lies with you. For me, the better solution to your concerns is, for each author, to replace all claims of P2093 by P50, as done in this case. Cheers, Nomen ad hoc (talk) 07:12, 16 August 2019 (UTC). @Nomen ad hoc: Thank you for your answer. And thanks for changing from author name string (P2093) to author (P50). Is there any tool for doing this or is it done manually? As you say the burden will be on the person claiming the article being notable, and have also given some basic criterias such as cited for a certain number of times. Pmt (talk) 19:29, 16 August 2019 (UTC) My pleasure. But sorry, I don't know any tool for this...

The statement is an example of a administrative territorial entity (Q56061). Xaris333 (talk) 04:00, 17 August 2019 (UTC) Building of Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Cyprus) (Q66488884) has located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) of Ayioi Omoloyites, Nicosia (Q16868998) which was a instance of (P31) of Parish of Nicosia Municipality (Q47320699), which was a instance of (P31) of third-level administrative division (Q13221722) rather than a subclass of (P279) of third-level administrative division (Q13221722). I've changed this now. (See https://w.wiki/7Cq) Teester (talk) 16:04, 17 August 2019 (UTC) List of ministers. Hello. Should I add all the ministers in Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Q3315347) using chairperson (P488) (like United States Department of State (Q789915)) or should I add them to Cypriot Minister of Foreign Affairs (Q25309937) with officeholder (P1308)? (Of course with qualifiers start time (P580) and end time (P582) for both cases). Xaris333 (talk) 04:32, 17 August 2019 (UTC) Well, a minister isn't a \"chairperson\" of its ministry, is it? So I would consider the second option. Nomen ad hoc (talk) 06:52, 17 August 2019 (UTC). So the list in United States Department of State (Q789915) is wrong and we should move it to United States Secretary of State (Q14213)? Xaris333 (talk) 07:19, 17 August 2019 (UTC) I think it is more likely that chairperson (P488) has a bad English-language label and should be \"presiding member\". - Jmabel (talk) 15:35, 17 August 2019 (UTC) Changing property labels is easily the most fractious thing I've ever seen attempted on Wikidata.

Image number of values Hey, why there is no warning, when somebody add more images into this value. I have seen it elsewhere and recently I was warned that this property should have just one value. --Juandev (talk) 16:24, 15 August 2019 (UTC) It doesn't have single-value constraint (Q19474404). --Matěj Suchánek (talk) 13:58, 18 August 2019 (UTC) Qualifiers for identifiers Which qualifiers should be included in identifiers? Schould they be inluded in references or schould they have references independly anyway (expect cases reference is needed to confirm that certain id is official)? Eurohunter (talk) 17:56, 15 August 2019 (UTC) Qualifiers are usually used to differenciate several values, and as identifier are by principle unique, no qualifier should be used with identifier. Snipre (talk) 21:59, 15 August 2019 (UTC) There are some exceptions to that rule, identifier shared with comes to mind? Moebeus (talk) @Snipre: Shouldn't it have atleast subject named as (P1810) (any expections?) or identifier shared with (P4070) in few cases (very rare I think)? Eurohunter (talk) 23:29, 15 August 2019 (UTC) I don't think there are any that should, but there are plenty that can. Some examples: Q7169723#P3615 has a good example of how qualifiers on an identifier can be appropriate - it uses subject has role (P2868) to clarify that it refers specifically to a certain type of administrative area, and has start/end dates because the admin area only existed in that period. Start/end dates can also be used where you have two identifiers that apply at different times (say an official ID scheme changed and they issued new ones for every item, or the external source breaks things down more granularly than we do). subject named as (P1810) means that you can say what name the identifier uses, which might be very useful if, say, you have an author who writes under two different pseudonyms, and there are identifiers for each of them separately. Andrew Gray (talk) 19:57, 16 August 2019 (UTC) @Andrew Gray: When I'm adding stated in (P248) as qualifier it shows me \"The source property should not be used in this location (as a qualifier). The only one valid for this property is as the source\". Eurohunter (talk) 21:07, 16 August 2019 (UTC) I think this is because that particular property should only be used in references - it doesn't matter if it's for a normal property or an identifier. Andrew Gray (talk) 21:33, 16 August 2019 (UTC) @Andrew Gray: Most of identifiers can't have references because it would be nonsense and would conflict with \"real references\" under identifiers that requires it. So what to do? Eurohunter (talk) 08:55, 17 August 2019 (UTC) @Eurohunter: I'm not quite sure what you're trying to do here - is there a more appropriate qualifier you could use than stated in (P248)? If it's only for references, and you aren't using references, it's probably not the right one. Andrew Gray (talk) 09:28, 17 August 2019 (UTC) @Andrew Gray: So why is bot adding it to references if it's not real reference? Eurohunter (talk) 10:54, 17 August 2019 (UTC) I don't understand what you're asking. Could you show me an example? Andrew Gray (talk) 13:05, 17 August 2019 (UTC) @Andrew Gray: [23] in reverse. Eurohunter (talk) 13:24, 17 August 2019 (UTC) @Eurohunter: The problem here is that stated in (P248) should only be used as a reference, not as a qualifier. So the bot moves it into the references section whenever it's added as a qualifier. In this case, though, I don't think it makes sense to add as a qualifier or as a reference - what is it you were trying to say by adding this qualifier? Andrew Gray (talk) 16:46, 17 August 2019 (UTC) @Andrew Gray: So what is the way to describe \"id provider\"? Eurohunter (talk) 19:04, 17 August 2019 (UTC) @Eurohunter: In this case, I don't think we need to. \"VIAF ID provided by VIAF\" doesn't seem like something we need to state at all? But if we were saying \"this ID was found in a different database\", then a reference with stated in (P248) would be sensible. Andrew Gray (talk) 09:39, 18 August 2019 (UTC) Participation in an event If a person is set as a participant in an event entry I do not see that the event shows up as participated in from the person entry. I would think that logically the relationship should be established between the two records, but I am new to Wikidata.

It is obviously intrinsically related to the place of work.Nomen ad hoc (talk) 16:00, 16 August 2019 (UTC). @Nomen ad hoc: educated at (P69) is not for the place where you teach, but where you studies. author TomT0m / talk page 16:09, 16 August 2019 (UTC) My bad, I meant P108. Nomen ad hoc (talk) 16:10, 16 August 2019 (UTC). I woukd say no for two reasons. (1) According to the property definition, this should have a value of a named professorship like Regius Professor of History (Q7309487) which by its definition will be associated with a university. (2) This property should be qualified with start time, end time, replaces, replaced by - you can’t qualify a qualifier. That said, this seems to be a widely misused property. Values like “professor” and “2001” are incorrect. Perhaps the definition needs to be refined. And we need to add a lot of additional named professorships. - PKM (talk) 19:57, 16 August 2019 (UTC) You're right. Yes, it really needs to be refined (what about chairs? And other academic positions?)... Don't hesitate, if you're motivated. (Furthermore, I've opened a — rather unsuccessful — property proposal for all kinds of academic positions/ranks.)

I saw two infoboxes of the Russian article ru:You Shook Me having the same image, but the infoboxes have different info. One is about Muddy Waters version; other the Led Zeppelin version. The Led Zeppelin image shouldn't have displayed a different release, so what can be done about it? George Ho (talk) 17:39, 17 August 2019 (UTC) Hello George! Thank You for Your message. I fixed it in Russian Wikipedia, is it all right now? --Ksc~ruwiki (talk) 18:31, 17 August 2019 (UTC) I see the edit now. Thanks, Ksc~ruwiki! Nonetheless, I would appreciate a hidden note like this: <!-- example -->. That way, most editors can understand why the edit is to be made. George Ho (talk) 18:54, 17 August 2019 (UTC) That's a solution used only in Russian Wikipedia (I am not sure about other Wikipedias). The mechanism described here (in Russian: \"Чтобы отключить свойство Викиданных, ничего не добавляя взамен, используйте в статье значение -. \" --Ksc~ruwiki (talk) 19:27, 17 August 2019 (UTC) In plwiki the word no (Q1814990) is used as argument for image file name to disable the image in those infoboxes, which uses some image property from Wikidata such as image (P18). Paweł Ziemian (talk) 17:44, 20 August 2019 (UTC) Ideally the two infoboxes would have two different items associated with them. --- Jura 17:57, 20 August 2019 (UTC) Obtain a label onwiki in a specific language I simply want, for example, the French label for Q34679 to be returned. (sable) If there is no French label, I want nothing. Reading w:en:Module:Wd, my impression is that this is not possible without changing that module to return what I want instead of the language of the wiki. (and I don't speak Lua, so that's that) How do I do this? Alexis Jazz please ping me if you reply 23:40, 18 August 2019 (UTC) @Alexis Jazz: {{#invoke:WikidataIB|getLabel|Q34679|lang=fr}} should do what you want - except the version of Module:WikidataIB here is a bit out of date, so you have to use it on enwp/commons/elsewhere with the latest version available.

Alexis Jazz please ping me if you reply 08:33, 19 August 2019 (UTC) @Mike Peel: The same thing doesn't work for descriptions, is that correct? They keep falling back to English.

Alexis Jazz please ping me if you reply 07:38, 20 August 2019 (UTC) I think this needs @RexxS: to add lang as a parameter for the getDescription function. Thanks. Mike Peel (talk) 09:52, 20 August 2019 (UTC) @Alexis Jazz, Mike Peel: It's not quite that simple, Mike. If you want the description in a particular language, you have to load the entire Wikidata entry, then look through the description table to find that language. Rather than have to import all of a modified WikidataIB and its dependencies into the Dutch Wiktionary, I've simply created nl:wikt:Module:Wdnl with the two requested functions. On its talk page, nl:wikt:Module talk:Wdnl, I've make some tests as a demo of how to call the functions and to show that they work in the way that I think was intended. if that doesn't do the job, then please let me know and I'll try again for you. Cheers --RexxS (talk) 16:09, 20 August 2019 (UTC) @RexxS: Ah, sorry, I thought it would be straightforward. Is that because there's no description version of mw.wikibase.getLabelByLang? Thanks. Mike Peel (talk) 20:47, 20 August 2019 (UTC) @Mike Peel: Principally that, but also determining whether the fallback languages are used or not. If I add the language parameter to WikidataIB|getDescription (which I can do), what do I do when someone else wants to be able to specify the language and have it fallback if that language has no description (which is how I treat getValue returns that are monolingual text)? I have all the code, so I suppose I could add a parameter |fallback=true or false for the call, and then the same for the labels. But it looks like work, so I think I'll wait for somebody to ask for the features. --RexxS (talk) 21:32, 20 August 2019 (UTC) @RexxS: OK, I've submitted a phab ticket for this at phab:T230839.

Can anyone edit the pt.wikipedia link in Q116933? The page has been moved from \"VK (rede social)\" to \"VK\" (proof). That means the item is linking to a redirect instead of the actual article.

ArthurPSmith (talk) 00:29, 21 August 2019 (UTC) Close to me: view Wikidata items on a map Hey everyone, i made a new tool that lets you see Wikidata items with a location based on your current location. It's basically a wrapper around the 'map' view on the query service, but without the need to write a complex SPARQL query ;) Check out Close to me. Husky (talk) 08:37, 19 August 2019 (UTC) Wow! Very interesting. Thanks! Nomen ad hoc (talk) 08:40, 19 August 2019 (UTC). Honestly, there should be a well-maintained app that would have one's phone buzz anytime one is next to any of those spots and that would then have one take a picture that would immediately be uploaded to Commons and added as a relevant image (P18) here. Using the built-in clock and calendar of the phone (and possibly image recognition technology) could bring that app to use nighttime view (P3451) or winter view (P5252) instead. Thierry Caro (talk) 09:38, 19 August 2019 (UTC) Magnus pointed me to WikiShootMe! which you can use to upload pictures. I would hope that in the future WD items could also be added to the already existing 'Places' tab on the Wikipedia app. Husky (talk) 10:55, 19 August 2019 (UTC) There's also the Commons app, which also shows the nearby Wikidata items. But not so smart - it includes items which are no longer existing, e.g. around my home it shows elements of the city wall torn down more than 100 years ago. My suggestion of filtering items with dissolved, abolished or demolished date (P576) hasn't made it into the app yet... Ahoerstemeier (talk) 08:25, 20 August 2019 (UTC) It's too bad the Commons app doesn't work on iOS :(. I could imagine showing items that have dissolved, abolished or demolished date (P576) might be interesting as well, a picture of the place where those city walls used to be might of use to an article as well...

The termbox is this area on Items where you can read or edit labels, descriptions and aliases in various languages. Our goal is to provide a nicer experience while reading and editing this area from the mobile web pages.Thanks to the combined work of various teams at WMDE and WMF, to our UX researchers and the editors who gave feedback on the prototypes, the first version of the feature is now deployed on wikidata.org. What is included in this new termbox interface? You can browse labels, descriptions and aliases on a new and more mobile-friendly interface, for all existing languages You can edit existing labels, descriptions and aliases directly from the interface of the Item The behaviour of the mobile termbox is very similar to the current termbox on desktop: preferred languages are sorted based on the Universal Language Selector extension, that is taking information from your Babel userbox (if you’re logged in) The edits made through the interface will have the “mobile edit” tag, so you can track them and watch out for vandalism What is not included yet, but may be in the future? A dedicated termbox-mobile tag in the edit summary, to track edits more precisely Adding labels, descriptions or aliases in languages that don’t contain anything for now (we’re working on it, in the meantime, you can do it with Special:SetLabelDescriptionAliases) Various interface enhancements (floating buttons, colors, icons, text labels) What was not included in the scope of this project Ability to edit something else than the Item termbox (eg. statements, Lexemes, other entity types) Any change on the desktop interface  How can you test it and give feedback? The feature is now live on wikidata.org, which means you can access any Item from a mobile device and check it out. You can also see it from desktop by clicking on the \"mobile view\" link at the very bottom of a page, or adding &mobileaction=toggle_view_mobile at the end of the URL. Example: Q666Please note that some pages are cached - if you don’t see the new termbox appearing on an Item, it will appear next time that someone edits this item.If you have any suggestions or would like to share feedback with us, you can write on the talk page of the termbox project.If you encounter any bug or serious technical issues, you can also create a task on Phabricator, using the tag Wikidata-Termbox.Cheers, Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 09:50, 21 August 2019 (UTC) Edit: the newly deployed feature seems to have created some errors on Special:NewItem on mobile. We're working on this and the issue should be fixed in the next 24 hours. Sorry for the inconvenience. Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 16:58, 21 August 2019 (UTC) Modelling the wiktionary … The wiktionary class tree is a mess. I think that this is partly because the item is actually merging different meaning : the community, the dictionary itself, the mediawiki website … I propose to sort that out by creating an item for the wiktionary as intellectual work (Q15621286)   and the wiktionary project as a Wikimedia projects (Q14827288)   . I also created an item for the website Q66542603   . Some wikipedia defines the wiktionary as a dictionary, some other as the project, which make the current item a little blurry however.There is relationships between all those items of course, I can think of ⟨ wiktionary (content) ⟩ produced by (P2849) ⟨ wiktionary (project) ⟩ ⟨ wiktionary (website) ⟩ maintained by (P126) ⟨ wikimedia ⟩ ⟨ wiktionary (website) ⟩ edited though Search ⟨ wiktionary (website) ⟩ … (I don’t know if we have properties for everything)The advantages are that the work item can clearly be subtyped as a kind of dictionary, and which, while the wiki itself is classified as a wiki … author TomT0m / talk page 10:11, 18 August 2019 (UTC) Support This sounds like a reasonable proposal to me. I see this kind of issue a lot where editors have combined multiple distinct concepts onto the same item. --SilentSpike (talk) 12:17, 18 August 2019 (UTC) It's unclear what it's going to fix and if isn't going to make a mess of every other WMF site entry. --- Jura 17:58, 20 August 2019 (UTC) @Jura1: We usually differenciate the work of some author and the authors itself, the editor, and we also discriminate editions of some work. Comparatively … why should we merge such different concept as a work, a community of authors, in the same items, for a few projects ? author TomT0m / talk page 08:21, 21 August 2019 (UTC) Lots of things are like this. The United States is an area, an organization, a set of people, a set of laws, etc. Splitting things up like that doesn't help. Wiktionary is a community, a dictionary, a website, and a project. --Yair rand (talk) 07:53, 21 August 2019 (UTC) We have items for the USA law [[d:Special:EntityPage/DROIT AUX ÉTATS-UNISTHE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA|DROIT AUX ÉTATS-UNISTHE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA]], the citizenship citizenship of the United States (Q15133865), its territory territory of the United States (Q1352230). We have concepts in political sciences to designate the United states as a political unit, see for example the polity (Q1063239). To me it’s absurd to assimilate all these concepts. The USA is a group of people that governs a certain territory according to certain rule that defines its organisation. The USA are not the territory. author TomT0m / talk page 08:34, 21 August 2019 (UTC) I think it's worth considering that all the wikimedia project items should be modelled the same way. Although there is a Wikipedia community (Q876040) (and there should reasonably be equivalents for the other projects), there is no separation between wikipedia as content as wikipedia as a website. They are, by and large, one and the same, and edited not through any purported \"wikimedia website\", but rather through MediaWiki (Q83). Anyway, before you start unleashing this on other items, how about you start with wikipedia items, and remember that there is not so much a Q66542603 as there are language editions (i.e. English Wiktionary (Q22001375)). Circeus (talk) 23:02, 21 August 2019 (UTC) drafts/manuscripts Is there a property to indicate that an item or URL is the draft version or manuscript of the item to which the property would be attached? Arlo Barnes (talk) 18:54, 21 August 2019 (UTC) @Arlo Barnes: We have study or design for (P6606) for the item of the draft. Thierry Caro (talk) 20:28, 21 August 2019 (UTC) Is Q55900412 the same as Q18202241 We have items for Hermann Butterweck (Q55900412) and Hermann Butterweck (Q18202241), two German actors with the same name, born the same month and died on the same day. They have different VIAF, GND and CERL IDs, but I suspect that they are the same person who had 2 entries in GND which were duplicated in VIAF and here. I am not sure if there is a way to establish if there were two such actors. Any ideas? --Jarekt (talk) 14:12, 21 August 2019 (UTC) @Jarekt: The names are not the same. But in a case like this you should follow through to the original sources - VIAF etc. may have links to other information about them; if there's any news article or other work that lists them that might help. Searching Google books or archive.org might also turn something up. Presumably if they are indeed different people, the death date and perhaps birth date only really applies to one of them. ArthurPSmith (talk) 16:56, 21 August 2019 (UTC) ArthurPSmith, thanks for pointing out difference in names, I did not noticed it. I did follow all the links I could find and I think they are all derivative of GND entry. Google search for term \"Hermann Buttersack\" finds no valid hits, nor does Google Books or archive.org. Perhaps there are other places to search, but other than bare bones GND and mirrors I see no proof that Hermann Butterweck (Q55900412) ever existed. Most likely it is a version of Hermann Butterweck (Q18202241) with a typo. --Jarekt (talk) 19:36, 21 August 2019 (UTC) That definitely sounds plausible. You didn't find the typo anywhere besides GND (and derivatives) then? ArthurPSmith (talk) 19:38, 21 August 2019 (UTC) No the name is used only at GND and derivatives (VIAF, ISNI, CERL & Wikidata) and none of derivatives has anything about the person other than the bare bones that GND has: name, dates and occupation. --Jarekt (talk) 20:47, 21 August 2019 (UTC) I think when this one first came up on Wikidata:Database reports/identical birth and death dates/1, we had a few similar ones, but for these others, VIAF/GND indicated that one name was an alias for the other. It does happen with pairs that come up on Wikidata:Database reports/identical birth and death dates that names and dates get mixed up, without the two persons being the same. For the pair discussed here, I had brought it up on Wikidata:Forum/Archiv/2018/11#Same_lifespan, but without much luck either. BTW, GND has some complicated way of indicating its source of their data. --- Jura 10:28, 22 August 2019 (UTC) Somebody should probably add a note on the item talk pages for these items at least, linking to this and previous discussions! ArthurPSmith (talk) 18:25, 22 August 2019 (UTC) New tools and IP masking Hey everyone, The Wikimedia Foundation wants to work on two things that affect how we patrol changes and handle vandalism and harassment. We want to make the tools that are used to handle bad edits better. We also want to get better privacy for unregistered users so their IP addresses are no longer shown to everyone in the world. We would not hide IP addresses until we have better tools for patrolling. We have an idea of what tools could be working better and how a more limited access to IP addresses would change things, but we need to hear from more wikis. You can read more about the project on Meta and post comments and feedback. Now is when we need to hear from you to be able to give you better tools to handle vandalism, spam and harassment. You can post in your language if you can't write in English. Johan (WMF)14:18, 21 August 2019 (UTC)Johan, one tool I would find very useful for patroling changes, is a single click undo button to reverse bad (malicious or careless) item merges. I see quite a lot cases where some fresh user merges 2 items (possibly using some tool or \"game\") which is plainly wrong. It takes a lot of work to restore two separate items and it is quite possible that other items linking to the merged items are never corrected properly. I know such tool has nothing to do with IP masking, but if you are looking for potential tools for resent change monitoring, that would be one I could really use. --Jarekt (talk) 19:50, 21 August 2019 (UTC) Seconded. --Daniel Mietchen (talk) 03:19, 22 August 2019 (UTC) It's easy if you do it right away, by reverting the two items. It's harder to do it a couple of years and a few hundred edits later, but that would also be hard to automate. Ghouston (talk) 10:40, 22 August 2019 (UTC) I agree that a one-click tool for undoing merges would be very useful for Wikidata. Especially a tool that also takes care about undoing the changed redirects that happened as a result of the merge. If we had such a tool we could make it easier to discover how to merge items for new users on Wikidata by not requiring to activate a gadget which would be a major step forward. Having a system for the redirects of merges that doesn't rely on a bot would be very helpful for other installations of Wikibase besides Wikidata where there's currently no automatic way to get redirects moved after a merge.

I think this is a work for a programme and not for the people they work here. Sometimes i have success and wikidata give the surname in the category and sometimes not and I must set a DEFAULTSORT. It must changed! I hate it. It is the baddest thing in this project. Adelfrank (talk) 09:06, 22 August 2019 (UTC) It's something you have Wikipediathat isn't using Wikidata for this. Each Wikipedia is free to use Wikidata (or not). --- Jura 09:09, 22 August 2019 (UTC) No, sorry - You don't understand me. It is the problem between Wikimedia commons and Wikidata!!! - Look here: [David Ameln] family name Ameln' and in Wikimedia commons he comes under A how Ameln [Category:Tenor opera vocalists] - But [David Pomeroy] family name Pomeroy comes in Wikimedia commons under D how David and I must set a DEFAULTSORT to receive P how Pomeroy. Where I must ask in which Wikipedia for this problem? It is a problem between Wikidata and Wikimedia commons and comes from Wikidata (the source). Adelfrank (talk) 09:38, 22 August 2019 (UTC) I thought you were complaining about Wikipedia. Sorry about that. If it's about Commons, the right place is probably c:Template_talk:Wikidata_Infobox. --- Jura 09:42, 22 August 2019 (UTC) @Adelfrank: If you set both family name (P734) and given name (P735), then you shouldn't need to manually define a DEFAULTSORT, the infobox will do it for you. In this case, I think it's a caching issue - you added the family name at about the same time as the infobox. In that case, try doing a null edit (edit the page, then save it without making any changes), or add \"?action=purge\" to the URL, in order to clear the cache. Thanks.

Most items that come up aren't interesting and inviting to edit. Maybe we can exchange \"random item\" with \"random content\" and have random content lead to a page that lists 'random item', 'random lexeme', 'random wikiproject' and 'random property'? ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 13:48, 21 August 2019 (UTC) I would prefer to replace random item with random entity (item, property, lexeme and whatever stuff we make up in the future).

Multichill (talk) 19:43, 22 August 2019 (UTC) If we have random entity, we should have some kind of weighting in the algorithm so that the fact that we have a lot more items then other entities doesn't mean that practically it shows every time an item. – The preceding unsigned comment was added by ChristianKl (talk • contribs) at 23. 8. 2019, 11:32‎ (UTC). University presidents I'm noticing a couple of different approaches for data about university presidents.In some cases, an item is created for the specific position, such as President of Harvard University (Q19588706) and this is given as a position held (P39) statement on an item for a person (such as Drew Gilpin Faust (Q49128)). In other cases, the more general item university president (Q4376769) is used for position held, along with of (P642) to name the university (such as Edward John Ray (Q5343795).Either approach seems valid, but is one preferred?(I've also seen statements using occupation (P106) with either university president (Q4376769) or an item for a specific position, but that is flagged as a potential issue because university president (Q4376769) is not currently an instance of occupation (Q12737077).) Lrobare (talk) 21:36, 19 August 2019 (UTC) Short answer (my view): probably the first of those - President of Harvard University (Q19588706) as a position held (P39) statement - since we tend towards increased granularity and because it supports easier queries. Ideally both approaches convey exactly the same information, although in fact the class trees for the two examples are currently worlds apart; Harvard President is a Rector which is a ..., and meanwhile a university president is something else altogether, the two meeting eventually at official (Q599151). So if subclass items such as President of Harvard University (Q19588706) are being relied on, the imperative is to square their class memberships with generic positions such as university president (Q4376769), else they become useless or positively harmful. --Tagishsimon (talk) 22:24, 19 August 2019 (UTC) +1. Nomen ad hoc (talk) 22:27, 19 August 2019 (UTC). I only create the entry President of Harvard University (Q19588706) if I am working on a list that has multiple entries, I do the same for Mayor of X and Commissioner of X and other positions. If I only have a single entry I use the second method with occupation (P106) filled in with the generic title. We could always have a bot create Mayor of X for every city in the USA, but almost everyone would have no entries. --RAN (talk) 03:16, 23 August 2019 (UTC) Q334406 and Q65683402 Are these really not the same thing? One's an 'abbatial church' and the other is an abbey. Renard Migrant (talk) 13:17, 23 August 2019 (UTC) No. One is a part of the other.

Is it correct to connect this kind of items with a list like en:List of Ministers of Communications and Works of Cyprus? Or is it better to have separate items like list of Ministers of Transport, Communications and Works (Q66583238)? I think the second option is better because en:List of Ministers of Communications and Works of Cyprus is Wikimedia list article (Q13406463) and not position (Q4164871). Xaris333 (talk) 05:05, 19 August 2019 (UTC) A Wikimedia list and a position are different concepts, so they need different items — that can be linked to each other with is a list of (P360)/has list (P2354).

Otherwise all is good. :-) Thanks. Mike Peel (talk) 09:27, 24 August 2019 (UTC) Which \"Sun Yat-Sen/Zhongshan Park\" the Q2622640 points to? At least on zhwiki, we do have hundres of such named parks. --Liuxinyu970226 (talk) 10:19, 19 August 2019 (UTC) The items seems to be a mess at the moment. The English item is a list of parks with that name. Likely, the item should be converted in a list item and I guess you also have an item that lists those parks on zhwiki. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 15:21, 19 August 2019 (UTC) I don't speak it, but from the shape of the article, the linked page on zhwiki looks likely to be such a list - many different places and different images. Agree on converting this item to be a list. Andrew Gray (talk) 11:49, 20 August 2019 (UTC) @Liuxinyu970226: given that you seem to be interested in the item I think it would be straightforward if you do the conversion to list article. Is there anything about that, that you don't feel comfortable with, so that you want that someone else helps you? ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 16:47, 20 August 2019 (UTC) @ChristianKl, Andrew Gray: why not call (and separate) that zhwiki article as Wikipedia article covering multiple topics (Q21484471) instead? There has also parks that are not met both zhwiki and Wikidata notability policies to have items (e.g. if your home has a garden that named \"Zhongshan Park\" by yourself). --Liuxinyu970226 (talk) 22:51, 22 August 2019 (UTC) @Liuxinyu970226: Looking at them, I think all the articles are lists of parks - some only have a few entries but none of them seem to be about one specific place. So it should be fine to convert the item. Andrew Gray (talk) 10:12, 24 August 2019 (UTC) Q18340392 This item, Q18340392, is used to classify a specific set of disambiguation pages relating to word senses (not homographs or homophones). it should still have some properties, but I am utterly stumped as to which property+item combinations are proper. Circeus (talk) 19:15, 23 August 2019 (UTC) IMHO, this item should not exist. It isn't linked to any category or wiki article; the concepts \"left behind\" and \"leaving\" have nothing to do with direction. If anything it belongs in lexemes. - PKM (talk) 21:30, 23 August 2019 (UTC) Thank you for unhelpfully answering a questoin that was never asked. Circeus (talk) 02:29, 24 August 2019 (UTC) As mentioned below, I tend to agree with PKM. --- Jura 11:45, 24 August 2019 (UTC) Also discussed at Wikidata_talk:Lexicographical_data#Different_meanings_of_the_word_for_the_direction_left. Maybe we could try to put disambiguation items to some use. However, I'm not sure if that is the best way to go. --- Jura 23:39, 23 August 2019 (UTC) Probable duplicate items I'm pretty sure https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5146516 and http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q51884243 represent the same thing and should be merged. I do know how to do merges, so no need to point me there, I just don't have enough knowledge about the royal family of Jordan to be absolutely certain they are actually not somehow different concepts that need to be separately maintained.

S8321414Notified participants of WikiProject ChemistryWikiProject Ontology has more than 50 participants and couldn't be pinged. Please post on the WikiProject's talk page instead. @Multichill, Jheald, Jane023, Spinster:Our modeling of pigments is all over the place. I'd like to find a consensus that works for both chemistry and art materials communities of practice. Here are some current examples: chrome yellow (Q1075109) <instance of> \"pigment\" and lead(II) chromate (Q367871) with alias \"chrome yellow\" <instance of> \"chemical compound\". These are minimally modeled and not linked to each other. Maya blue (Q901499) <instance of> \"color\" but matched to the pigment in AAT. Prussian blue (Q421894) <instance of> \"medication, essential medicine, pigment, color\". red ocher (Q54806372) AKA red ocher <instance of> \"pigment, painting technique\" alizarin (Q267813) AKA Turkey red, pigment red 83 <instance of> \"chemical compound\" matched to AAT's \"colorant for dye and pigment\". mars black (Q10541832) <instance of> \"iron oxide pigment\", <material used> iron(II,III) oxide (Q411235) <instance of> \"chemical compound\". pigment blue 16 (Q414162) AKA phthalocyanine <instance of> \"chemical compound\" with no mention of pigment despite the labels. I think we should have some agreement on these points: The named color should be a separate item from the pigment (I think we've reached consensus on this before). Should the chemical compound and pigment be the same item? If so, should the model be <instance of> \"chemical compound\" and <instance of> \"pigment\" or something else? (We might have <use>=\"pigment\", but does this make querying for pigments counterintuitive?) Should pigments be linked to their named colors with <named after> on the color and <color> on the pigment? And lastly, is there enough interest in this topic to make a WikiProject (maybe dyes and pigments) where we can discuss and document best practices? - PKM (talk) 22:04, 23 August 2019 (UTC) Please no new Wikiproject: already now too few contributors are involved in existing Wikiproject and we are missing an overview of the problems, partially due to the fact that each one is working in his corner. To come back to the mentioned problem, my first question is: What is a pigment ? To solve ontological problem we need definitions. If I take the English definition of pigment and chemical compound I have the following: pigment (Q161179): material that changes the color of reflected or transmitted light chemical compound (Q11173): pure chemical substance consisting of two or more different chemical elements Can we link material and chemical substance ? material (Q214609): substance that can occur in different amounts, all with some similar [mixture of some] characteristics, and of which objects can be made up chemical substance (Q79529): matter of constant composition best characterized by the entities (molecules, formula units, atoms) it is composed of It seems we can find a link but we need to unify the upper classes of both items before to be able to merge anything. But I think a pigment is a chemical substance but not a pure chemical substance: some pigment are mixtures of several chemical compounds (chemical compound is a pure chemical substance). So if we want to model that case too we can't systematically merge pigment and chemical compound. I think we have a similar situation with drug: there are often one chemical active substance, but in really a drug is a mixture of several chemical compounds. Snipre (talk) 21:04, 24 August 2019 (UTC) Are there a way to block scientific articles from showing up in search results? It often makes it quite hard to find what i'm looking for. --Trade (talk) 03:01, 18 August 2019 (UTC) Agree, or have an option to sort them to the list bottom. The usefulness of autocompletion completely vanishes if objects only show up if their labels have been written out. --SCIdude (talk) 06:19, 18 August 2019 (UTC) See also Wikidata:Requests_for_permissions/Bot/LargeDatasetBot, which will import 12 million more such articles. − Pintoch (talk) 09:41, 18 August 2019 (UTC) On Special:Search, you can append -haswbstatement:P31=Q13442814 to your searches to exclude all items with instance of (P31): scholarly article (Q13442814). That should already help a lot. Unfortunately, it does apparently not work if you type the search term directly into the search form on the upper right corner. --MisterSynergy (talk) 13:07, 18 August 2019 (UTC) In other words, autocompletion should be configurable the way Special:Search is. --SCIdude (talk) 13:40, 18 August 2019 (UTC) @MisterSynergy: Are you referring to the autocomplete dropdown, or to making a Special:Search query by typing text into the search box and pressing Enter? If the latter, you can additionally get item results only by prefixing the search query with \": \" (Special:Search defaults to properties only for me, and I'm not sure how to change that; if this is happening for you then this would work). Jc86035 (talk) 07:55, 19 August 2019 (UTC) Generally the search algortihm tries to rank scientific articles lower then other items. Can you give example of searchers you did where you think that the scientific articles get ranked to highly? ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 19:12, 18 August 2019 (UTC) @ChristianKl:*typing \"neuropatholog\" --> medical specialty at #30 after roughly 39 scientific articles but full \"neuropathology\" --> medical specialty at #1 --Trade (talk) 11:57, 25 August 2019 (UTC) @ChristianKl: E.g. aiming at the object labelled \"angiotensinogen\", typing \"angiot\" gives a drug object at #1, the rest are all scientific articles. The target shows up with \"angiotensino\" but only at #5 after 4 articles. --SCIdude (talk) 06:09, 19 August 2019 (UTC) From looking at that search, that does seem wrong. I'm not sure why the search behaves the way it does. It would be good if we would have >10 examples like this of where the search engine works poorly and give it to the developers to tune the search engine to give better results. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 07:02, 19 August 2019 (UTC) @ChristianKl: As you wish (from my field): typing \"kissp\" --> only scientific articles but full \"kisspeptin\" --> gene at #1 typing \"cathel\" --> only scientific articles but \"cathelicidin\" --> group of peptides at #1 typing \"preproe\" --> only scientific articles but \"preproendothelin-1\" --> non-article items at #1-4 typing \"proglu\" --> only scientific articles but \"proglucagon\" --> protein at #1 typing \"preproi\" --> protein at #3 after 2 scientific articles typing \"apeli\" --> only scientific articles but \"apelin\" --> six non-article items <==== !! typing \"thymosin\" --> only scientific articles but \"thymosin beta\" --> 3 non-article items, enough? --SCIdude (talk) 07:36, 19 August 2019 (UTC) I think that's a good portion for the drug items. If there's a different items that have a similar problem it would be great to have example items of the problem as well @Lea_Lacroix_(WMDE): can you interface with the development team about tuning the search algorithm again? ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 07:45, 19 August 2019 (UTC) it should also help the search algorithm if wi link articles to their main topics. It’s a lot of work but as a very good hint of topic for the article is that the subject of research is present in the article title, it should be able to create a wikidata game or something like that to help to do that. If the topic become used in such statements, it should be higher ranked in the results, or am I being naive ? (of course it’s not an immediate answer to the problem). author TomT0m / talk page 19:32, 18 August 2019 (UTC) A simple query shows quite promising results. author TomT0m / talk page 19:48, 18 August 2019 (UTC) I'm uncertain whether we get millions of instances of people playing the game. It would be nice to have such a game but I don't know if it will move the needle. More direct Zotero integration would be great for having more main subject claims. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 07:02, 19 August 2019 (UTC) I think it's pretty obvious from the apeli/apelin example alone that articles get ranked first and get only overtaken if the item is spelled out in full, which completely nulls the value of autocompletion. That's a bug in my dictionary. --SCIdude (talk) 07:47, 19 August 2019 (UTC) As far as I remember we introduced a punishment for items types that come from big imports. Items about the proteins are supposed to rank less well then some other items. Songs and movie titles are behave in a similar way. It would be intersting to know if the problem appears the same way for normal items. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 09:35, 19 August 2019 (UTC) I can understand that (1 million) proteins are ranked below less numerous objects. Scientific articles however are many millions, so by that logic should be ranked to the very bottom. --SCIdude (talk) 13:21, 19 August 2019 (UTC) I do agree, my point was that it's useful to know whether the problem also exists for other items and that's why it would be good if the people who had problems at commons would also add a few examples, so that everybodies usecases are covered when the algorithm gets updated. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 15:30, 19 August 2019 (UTC) Duplicate Item Is there a way to duplicate an item from another item or a template?

Mahir256 (talk) 23:34, 23 August 2019 (UTC) If they are all similar, you might want to use QuickStatements --- Jura 23:43, 23 August 2019 (UTC) Are there any plans to make QuickStatements more user friendly or less complicated? The fact that you need to own a license of Microsoft Excel in order to use it is kind of a let down. --Trade (talk) 00:31, 25 August 2019 (UTC) That's a prize-winning fatuous statement, as if OpenOffice or LibraOffice or text editors or OpenRefine don't exist. Quickstatements is minimally complicated given the job it does. --Tagishsimon (talk) 00:33, 25 August 2019 (UTC) QuickStatements just needs a CSV (or tab-delimited?) file as input, right? Those are industry-standard formats, with several million different tools which can generate them. They're totally not limited to Excel. —Scs (talk) 02:31, 25 August 2019 (UTC) I quite like the way the WE-Framework gadget looks and works. If you gave it the ability to customize the properties available, save statements and run batches i could totally see it work. --Trade (talk) 03:34, 25 August 2019 (UTC) Thanks for the info! --D-Kuru (talk) 11:49, 24 August 2019 (UTC) @D-Kuru: I forgot to mention https://tools.wmflabs.org/wikidata-todo/cradle/ for another approach. --- Jura 11:51, 24 August 2019 (UTC) Why not create an empty item, merge the original into it, and restore the original, as described in Help:Merge? --SCIdude (talk) 12:18, 24 August 2019 (UTC) I think I saw some user do that and then edit only the English label/description. duplicate_item.js can lead to this as well. BTW, User:Matěj_Suchánek/moveClaim.js can create a new item .. and allows to just copy statements one needs. --- Jura 12:34, 24 August 2019 (UTC) Problems of bibliographic records w.r.t Q66724823 What's the difference between OCLC control number (P243) and OCLC work ID (P5331)? Please add this book's OCLC number 711513523. Is there a bot that would crawl worldcat and fill up info according to OCLC no. or ISBN? Searching an item by ISBN is too user-unfriendly. Take the example of ISBN-13 La Fraternité de l'Anneau (Q22137041), searching 9782267027006 would not find it. Seriously? Most lay users would not care about the dashes.--Roy17 (talk) 14:39, 24 August 2019 (UTC) @Roy17: several things are very strange for this item. First is it a work or an edition? It seems to be an edition but which one? on Commons/Internet Archive, this is the 1988 edition with an ISBN-10 but you added an ISBN-13 (which is for editions after 2007, I corrected this ISBN to add the dashes but I can't find it in any database). For this identifier \"711513523\", it's a OCLC control number (P243) (for edition) and not OCLC work ID (P5331) (for work). For the search, true it should be improved to give results even if you input without the dashes; that said, the ISBN numbers should always be stored with dashes (removing dashes is super easy, adding them can be quite tricky and almost impossible to do automatically). @Lea Lacroix (WMDE): could it be possible? (I vaguely remember that CirrusSearch has option for this but I can't find it…) Cdlt, VIGNERON (talk) 12:33, 25 August 2019 (UTC) @VIGNERON: thx a lot! I wanted to add the oclc no., but didnt know which to pick, so copied an ISBN. Since I intend to add a record from worldcat, oclc no. is reliable but isbn might not be, so I edited the item.--Roy17 (talk) 12:47, 25 August 2019 (UTC) @Roy17: no problem, I added a instance of (P31) and the ISBN-10 (P957). PS: for the name of the Commons cat, should it be \"sheng wu\" or \"shengwu\"? Cheers, VIGNERON (talk) 13:59, 25 August 2019 (UTC) @VIGNERON: the current name is in pinyin character by character, so it is sheng wu.

We have an item Shōzō Numa (Q3959910) who is a pen name of Tetsuo Amano (Q3519206). Tho items have different VIAF numbers and some other identifiers. Should we use one or two items to model this? --Jarekt (talk) 22:28, 24 August 2019 (UTC) List the alt identifiers under the real name with a object named as (P1932) statement and criterion used (P1013)pen name (Q127843) ? (Typically this would be a reason for deprecated rank (P2241) statement instead of object named as (P1932), but I don't think that's appropriate here.) Circeus (talk) 05:32, 25 August 2019 (UTC) Shōzō Numa (Q3959910) is shared pseudonyn of unknown authors. Some reference said Tetsuo Amano (Q3519206) is one of them.--Afaz (talk) 07:42, 25 August 2019 (UTC) oh, then the details of who wrote what are on the individual works, and the pseudonym is a collective pseudonym (Q16017119). Circeus (talk) 16:45, 25 August 2019 (UTC) \"Organization of formation\" I noticed it is a constraint error that the organization NAFS(k) (Q10593756) has location of formation (P740) set to the school Nya Elementar (Q10604257). It's because the school is not a geographical feature (Q618123), which makes sense, because a school could change its physical location and still continue as the same entity. So it would be correct to replace this with a geographical object where the school was located. But still, is there a valid way to store that the foundation was at that school? Pst (talk) 06:09, 25 August 2019 (UTC) The proper way would probably be to create a new item for the school building and use that one as the value for location of formation (P740). --Kam Solusar (talk) 23:43, 25 August 2019 (UTC) ID's One more time. @Obsuser: vandalised names for ID's like Facebook, Instagram, IMDB or SoundCloud.

The Techstorm stems from an initiative of the Dutch Gender Gap group, to promote women's participation online in Wikimedia projects. Although this is still our foundation, we are now offering a low-threshold introduction to the world of Wikidata, Wikimedia Commons and linked open data to a wider audience.Do you recognize yourself in the following categories? Beginning or experienced developers with an interest in Wiki projects; Experienced Wikimedian who wants to learn (more) about the technique behind Wiki projects; Data specialist, information specialist and digital collection manager working in the heritage sector and/or library sector who would like to learn (more) about sharing collections via Wiki projects? Then sign up for participation!More information about the Techstorm can be found on wikimedia.nl: information about last year's Techstorms can be found on Mediawiki. There are several chapters who offer scholarships for travel and board.On behalf of the organization a warm greeting, Ciell (talk) 19:50, 26 August 2019 (UTC) @Ciell: good news! You expect to accept a lot of them? :-) Multichill (talk) 19:56, 26 August 2019 (UTC) Hi Multichill! Though we'd love to accept every application off course, we have to limit our number of participants to 60 people. This is now our third time organising a Techstorm and we think we are really developing a formula which creates retention and growth, as well in diversity as in numbers, within the communities, and we hope that we can inspire other chapters to adopt the concept. Please get in touch if, after reading through our documents and recommendations on mediawiki, you would like to organise a Techstorm in your home country and have questions or need help. Kind regards, Ciell (talk) 20:03, 26 August 2019 (UTC) Requesting help Dear fellow members of this wikiproject, I am new here (I am older in the English wikipedia), so I want to request your assistance. I have created 2 Items, the second is the one I need help. (here). That Greek company, FARCO, was brought by Chrysler and was renamed Chrysler Hellas S.A.. I chose the \"replaced by\" statement, I typed that but it said it is invalid. I chose the \"unknown value\" and \"no value\" options in the small box, but now it displays no place to type. Can someone help me out? Best regards, Enivak (talk) 21:24, 26 August 2019 (UTC) @Enivak: What is the Wikidata {{Q}} code for the item that FARCO (Q66763562) was replaced by (P1366)? –MJL ‐Talk‐☖ 21:46, 26 August 2019 (UTC) MJL You mean Chrysler Hellas S.A? If yes, I think it does not exist, this is generally the problem (has no code) Enivak (talk) 21:49, 26 August 2019 (UTC) @Enivak: Ah, well then you'll likely need to make that item as well. Basically, the property replaced by (P1366) requires a second item in order to make a complete statement. Alternatively, you can make \"Chrysler Hellas S.A.\" an alias like I previously did. Then you can add parent organization (P749) is Stellantis North America (Q181114). Does that help explain things? –MJL ‐Talk‐☖ 21:56, 26 August 2019 (UTC) MJL I will try to see if that helps, if not I will post it here.Enivak (talk) 22:01, 26 August 2019 (UTC) Update: I will do the the second thing you said, thank you very. much! Enivak (talk) 22:03, 26 August 2019 (UTC) PHP script to run a Query gets 403 error I'm taking my first stab at using a PHP script to read results of a query against Wikidata. When I use a GET URI in a browser window I have no trouble, but when I use the PHP script provided in the CODE link on the query page, I get a 403 http error. Is this a permissions errors (as 403 would suggest)? Do I need an API code or some such thing? A request for permissions? The script I'm working on is more interactive than what I'd call a bot, but maybe the bot rules apply and I need to apply for bot permissions? The fact that the query results page includes the PHP code makes me think it ought to \"just\" work. Any advice?Thanks - Kenirwin (talk) 21:50, 26 August 2019 (UTC) @Kenirwin: Not my area, but possibly a custom user agent issue: https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikidata/2019-July/013283.html --Tagishsimon (talk) 22:36, 26 August 2019 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: - thanks, that was helpful. Deletion of birthdates On Trygve Ottersen (Q66424846) the birthdate have/was been deleted with the reason please provide a reference for this date . Adding a birthdate to a person gives Suggestions citation needed constraint Statements for date of birth should have at least one reference. Is this an indication that whenever I come across an unrefferenced birthdate on Wikidata I shall delete it, or should I just await and have confidence that sooner or later an Reference will be added. My opinion is that even if no reference is provided and it is a suggestion someone have given this date because they hade found it somewhere?. imported from Wikimedia project (P143) can not be used here since the date first have been deleted on the wikipedia and then deleted in Wikidata. Pmt (talk) 12:55, 17 August 2019 (UTC) Birthdates are very rarely incorrect in Wikipedia / Wikidata, because the subject of a biography (or a family member) typically corrects it if he or she sees that it is wrong. All statements should have a reference, but I wouldn't blindly delete a birthdate without a reference, unless I had specific reasons to believe that it was incorrect. Regards, Kjetil_r (talk) 13:44, 17 August 2019 (UTC) The subject of a Wikidata item very rarely sees it and therefore is unlikely to correct an error - we should not rely on that happening. Nikkimaria (talk) 00:17, 18 August 2019 (UTC) But they will see the connected wikipedia lemma, and correct it there. From there we could add it to a list where the dates between different wikipedias and wikidata (and other sources) differ. More sources means more checks so more chances to find errors, and improve the contents from there. Edoderoo (talk) 14:20, 18 August 2019 (UTC) English Wikipedia does not allow the subject of an article to edit the article. In fact, it is not just \"first person\" banning, it is any personal involvement with the subject of an article. That means the offspring, or the media agents (for a celebrity), or even me, who was blocked for a COI when I tried to correct the spelling of my ex-girlfriend's son's name. Quakewoody (talk) 16:20, 18 August 2019 (UTC) When we had the RfC about living persons the community decided against having a bot that goes and automatically removes privacy sensitive statements. This suggest that there's no desire to have people go out and simply remove all uncited privacy sensitive statements. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 17:51, 18 August 2019 (UTC) @Pmt: (because of this edit) Deleting all birthdate statements that don't have at least one reference is one thing, removing a birthdate statement because one was not able to verify it with reliable sources another. Wikidata statements should generally be supported by referenceable sources (see Help:Sources). There are some exceptions, but I don't think that this birthdate is one of them. There are even stricter rules for biographies of living people (see Wikidata:Living_people). Please provide a reference if you want to keep this statement. - Valentina.Anitnelav (talk) 17:56, 20 August 2019 (UTC) @Valentina.Anitnelav: Wikidata statements should generally be supported by referenceable Sources. Do yuo require this for all unsourced birthdates? Is this discussed within the sosiety. @ChristianKl: With respect to Your comment above, can you provide this discussion With some References? Pmt (talk) 18:04, 20 August 2019 (UTC) @Valentina.Anitnelav: Can you please in this discussion describe and define the term reliable Soure, what a soure is and where I can find these definitions? Pmt (talk) 18:15, 20 August 2019 (UTC) @Pmt: Help:Sources lists some kind of sources that may be appropriate references (books, scientific papers, databases, etc.) and in Wikidata:Verifiability you can find more information about the relevance of sources. Help:Sources explicitly excludes Wikipedia as an appropriate source (\"Please note that while pages on Wikipedia (and other Wikimedia sites) should and can be added as sitelinks, they are not appropriate as sources for Wikidata statements.\"). If a source is a \"reliable\" or \"referenceable\" or \"appropriate\" or \"authoritative\" source does also depend on the context and may be subject of debate, but Bibsys seems quite appropriate to me for this statement.- Valentina.Anitnelav (talk) 18:42, 20 August 2019 (UTC) @Pmt: Wikidata:Requests_for_comment/Privacy_and_Living_People was the RfC that lead to the current Living people policy and there you see the consensus against bots being used to enforce the policy automatically. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 11:34, 27 August 2019 (UTC) Petscan help A while ago someone who was more tech savvy than I am set up this pet scan for me, so that I could just enter category name from the English Wikipedia, and it would tell me corresponding articles on the English Wikiquote that were in the same category as defined by Wikidata. It no longer seems to be working and give an error: \"manual wiki requested as output, but not set\". I'm afraid I'm not pet-scan-inclined enough to know what this means or how to fix it. GMGtalk 12:56, 23 August 2019 (UTC) When I have the interface preloaded through your link, I can see nothing that would be even close to what it used to do. Either you copied a wrong link or the query isn't working in the new version (although the opposite was suggested). --Matěj Suchánek (talk) 16:41, 23 August 2019 (UTC) For the old version of PetScan, use https://petscan1.wmflabs.org. So, this PetScan should work. - Premeditated (talk) 17:10, 23 August 2019 (UTC) Thanks all. GMGtalk 18:07, 23 August 2019 (UTC) @GreenMeansGo: It looks like there's some changes to the way it handles \"manual sources\" in the new version (you need to specify the wiki in a different place), which is why it's throwing an error. However, weirdly, the new one doesn't seem to like enwikiquote - you can do the query for commons or enwikisource, but not quote. I'll file it as a bug and let you know the URL for the updated PetScan when it's resolved :-). (The answers will be the same, but hopefully the new one will run a bit faster & more reliably for you.) Andrew Gray (talk) 20:21, 23 August 2019 (UTC) Awesome. Thanks for the help. GMGtalk 20:23, 23 August 2019 (UTC) @GreenMeansGo: Okay, bug fixed, and here's the completed version. (The old URLs should hopefully convert over now as well) Thanks to @Magnus Manske: for fixing the WQ issue (& for all of Petscan)! To quickly walk through how this works so you can reconstruct it in future if you want: tab 1, \"Categories\", tells it to find all pages, on enwiki, which are in \"Category:American Nobel laureates\". Depth = 0 means it will not include any subcategories. tab 4, \"other sources\", tells it that we want the results to be given as enwikiquote pages - this is the \"use wiki\" option at the bottom. It will thus only give answers which have a valid enwikiquote link. Everything else is left blank/default. Andrew Gray (talk) 12:24, 27 August 2019 (UTC) Awesome. Thanks again. (My previous offer still stands. I'll donate $50 to the charity of your choice for anyone who can get this to work with cat-a-lot.) GMGtalk 12:28, 27 August 2019 (UTC) Rejected property proposal When rejected property proposal can be reapplied? Should I create new proposal page or update the old one? Eurohunter (talk) 10:10, 24 August 2019 (UTC) It depends why it was reject. Some just get closed because they are incomplete, stale or none was interested. Unless there is a problem with the closure of the previous proposal, please create a new subpage. --- Jura 10:22, 24 August 2019 (UTC) What do you mean with 'rejected because they are stale'? --Trade (talk) 00:28, 25 August 2019 (UTC) @Trade: Just take a look at a bunch of close reasons.

ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 08:21, 27 August 2019 (UTC) Nth generation lineal descendant Is there a way to model lineal descendants of the Nth generation from an ancestor in relative (P1038) statements? lineal descendant (Q19671714) can be used as a value of kinship to subject (P1039) qualifier, but how to provide information for a specific generation? For the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th generation, we have specific items such as son's son (Q23684609), great-grandson (Q19682170), great-great-grandson (Q19682183), and great-great-great-grandchild (Q53277248), but how about other generations? Should we create items for each of them? For example, H. H. Kung (Q631416) is a 75th generation descendant of Confucius (Q4604). What would be the best way to model it? Moreover, how to specify that a lineal descendant (Q19671714) is from the male/female line? --Stevenliuyi (talk) 22:24, 24 August 2019 (UTC) You could just add P22/p40? Wikidata:WikiProject_Genealogy/numbers/descendants has a query for a list that already includes many descendants of Confucius (Q4604). --- Jura 09:06, 25 August 2019 (UTC) Yes, but that only works when all the intermediate persons in the line of descent are known, right? For those who are not in or close to the main line of descent (see Family tree of Confucius in the main line of descent (Q5433401)), it would be hard to find the information. --Stevenliuyi (talk) 11:17, 25 August 2019 (UTC) For the U.S. presidents they use series ordinal (P1545), so why not as qualifier for lineal descendant (Q19671714)? --SCIdude (talk) 05:44, 26 August 2019 (UTC) To describe if somebody is from the male or female line is essential in my language. There are always two ways to write grandfather/son, aunt, uncle etc. There are six (6) ways to write great grandfather in Swedish. And two ways are appropriate in each case. The other four are not. IP 62.20.170.74 (Hej!) 07:25, 26 August 2019 (UTC) @Stevenliuyi, Sextvå.tvånoll.ettsjunoll.sjufyra: Seems like the easiest approach here would be to have \"lineal descendant in the male line\" and \"lineal descendant in the female line\" items, both instances of kinship & subclasses of lineal descendant (Q19671714), to use as the kinship to subject (P1039) qualifier? That's what we do with things like maternal uncle (Q4120409) and it seems to work well - see this query for all the different types of precise kinship that are currently in use. Andrew Gray (talk) 12:20, 27 August 2019 (UTC) Grammy Are Grammies instance of (P31), subclass of (P279) or part of (P361) of Grammy Awards (Q41254)? Because now there are all types... --Infovarius (talk) 09:21, 27 August 2019 (UTC) I think subclass of (P279) should be used all the way through, except to use instance of (P31) for an item describing an individual award event (X person received Y award on this date) - which I don't think we typically add as items anyway, rather using statements with award received (P166) on the item for the person. So basically, it should probably be subclass of (P279) everywhere for awards. ArthurPSmith (talk) 13:48, 27 August 2019 (UTC) Semi-protected item?

In this case you will get an error that comes from the fact that frwiki has articles on both topics. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 11:13, 27 August 2019 (UTC) @Hari Seldon: When looking at the error message it seems to me that it quite cleanly explains that frwiki has an article for both items.

We would like to be able to mark those of them that have been listed but marked as removed or uncertain to be able to use that for filtering them out from the lists. Which method to choose? Remove them entirely from Wikidata, or describe them with a property. Which one? – Susanna Ånäs (Susannaanas) (talk) If the archaeological sites are real, they shouldn't be deleted from Wikidata. Can you tell us more about the criteria based on which you want to mark them? ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 12:31, 27 August 2019 (UTC) (conflict) It depends on the situation: The site is no longer listed --> add end time (P582) as a qualifier to heritage designation (P1435) The site does no longer exist --> add a statement state of conservation (P5816): demolished or destroyed (Q56556915) Site existence or location is uncertain --> you could maybe use sourcing circumstances (P1480) as a qualifier of instance of (P31) or coordinate location (P625) but I'm less confortable with this solution. Ayack (talk) 12:37, 27 August 2019 (UTC) Answering both: The two types of sites that should be marked are The site is possibly an archaeological site rather than a pile of rocks The site is an archaeological site, but it has either been demolished or removed and relocated – Susanna Ånäs (Susannaanas) (talk) 12:56, 27 August 2019 (UTC) Vision and strategy papers for Wikidata and Wikibase are published Hi everyone :)More than 7 years ago we started the development of Wikidata. We started out with the main goal of building a central data store for Wikipedia. Very quickly we expanded to also covering the other Wikimedia projects. Then came the interest from people outside Wikimedia to use Wikidata’s data to build their own apps, websites, visualisations and more. And last year we witnessed a significant interest in Wikibase, the software behind Wikidata. This means our work has expanded very significantly from what we started out with. We noticed that more and more people need clarity and certainty about where Wikidata and Wikibase are going. Because of this WMDE and WMF started discussing this more deeply and wrote down a lot of the things we have been talking about in the Wikidata and Wikibase communities over the last years.The result of these conversations include one product vision paper and three product strategy papers that we are publishing today: Vision: This paper gives a high-level overview of where we’d like to see Wikidata and Wikibase evolve and grow, based on the work of the past 7 years and many conversations with community members, movement partners, and other stakeholders. Wikidata for Wikimedia projects: This paper dives deeper into how we see Wikidata developing in the context of the Wikimedia projects and how it can better support the projects. Wikidata as a platform: This paper explores the value of Wikidata as a source of data for others outside Wikimedia to build upon. Wikibase Ecosystem: This paper goes deeper into the idea of the Wikibase Ecosystem, a network of Wikibase instances which share data and other capacities. I would love for you to read these papers now and give your feedback. We are collecting feedback until the end of October and will then integrate it as appropriate into a second iteration of the papers.The papers are published at m:Wikidata/Strategy/2019. Please leave your feedback and questions on the associated talk page.I am looking forward to reading your input.Cheers --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 16:52, 27 August 2019 (UTC) Alternative ship name: qualifier? Hi, after editing the item about the vessel Dida, I got warning signs about the property 'Alternative name' that I had chosen to represent this information about the various names of the vessel: Amstel (1998) Fort Mingan (1995) Nordbec (1970) Oslo (1969) Dida (1962) The information blob says that 'Alternative name' should only be used as a qualifier, but I can't find the property to which this property belongs. Anyway such a qualifier would need a subqualifier for the year.I believe it would be best to create a property (re)name or christening with qualifiers for date, place, the organisation (shipping line, navy) that ordered the (re)christening, and possibly the ceremonial christener and more. Merchant vessels are sold frequently as illustrated above and subsequent shipping lines generally apply new names.Maybe there is already a solution in place I am not aware of? Thanks! — bertux 12:50, 27 August 2019 (UTC) You should use official name (P1448) with start time (P580) and end time (P582) instead. Ayack (talk) 13:05, 27 August 2019 (UTC) Actually, since there are various properties used (short name (P1813), native label (P1705), etc.) you should ask your question to Wikidata:WikiProject Ships.

Hi, It seems that there's a lot of misuses of P131 as a qualifier. I think there's 2 typical misuses : When P131 point to a division who is containing the qualified statement, as I can see, by example, in P19 : SELECT ?lnLabel ?laLabel ?item
{
  ?item p:P19 ?n .
  ?n ps:P19 ?ln .
  ?n pq:P131 ?la .
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }
}
 Try it! When P131 point to a subdivision of the qualified statement, as I can see, by example, in P17 : SELECT ?lnLabel ?laLabel ?item
{
  ?item p:P17 ?n .
  ?n ps:P17 ?ln .
  ?n pq:P131 ?la .
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }
}
 Try it! I think that in the first case, the qualifier can be delete. But before doing this on ~23,000 items, the French chat propose to me to expose the situation here to have more feedback. So, what do you think about that Simon Villeneuve (talk) 20:53, 27 August 2019 (UTC) It can be useful when the parent division is not obvious at the time used in a statement. Some Wikipedias probably want (for infoboxes) but can't derive a full chain of hierarchy at specific moment of time so they depend upon such information. --Infovarius (talk) 21:52, 27 August 2019 (UTC) I'm curious (as I believe it is an overused property even as a main statement): are there any legitimate use of located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) as a qualifier to begin with? Circeus (talk) 23:15, 27 August 2019 (UTC) Take Maade (Q1882240) - while using located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) as a qualifier for country (P17) is IMHO nonsense, it is totally valid for the mouth of the watercourse (P403) statement - and I also added it a few times for rivers in past that way. Ahoerstemeier (talk) 07:47, 28 August 2019 (UTC) I think it can be useful for situations like with Middlesbrough (Q2673020) where located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) is North Yorkshire (Q23086) but on the next level it has alternatives. In most other cases, this is absolutely not necessary. Сидик из ПТУ (talk) 10:43, 28 August 2019 (UTC) @Сидик из ПТУ: I don't understand : P131 isn't used as a qualifier on Q2673020. Simon Villeneuve (talk) 13:24, 28 August 2019 (UTC) Yes, but I think this would be a great solution to build the correct geo-chains in similar cases. Using P131 here like a switch is better than applies to part (P518) on the next level because we can find more difficult cases where such refinements will be needed for each farm or rock, not just for five districts. For example, Znamianka rural hromada (Q46706877) is situated on territories of three districts (read Ukrainian article).

Is there a better alternative for one of these, or do we need an additional item? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 15:15, 28 August 2019 (UTC) @Pigsonthewing: I would love to see \"recording engineer\" separated out, at least. In general this area could do with some fleshing out by someone who knows the field. On a side note, the term \"engineer\" is used very loosely by English speakers while (at least in) Scandinavia it's a protected title that comes with a certain education. So what you call engineer, would often be a mere \"technician\" to us ;-) Moebeus (talk) Words with a masculine and a feminine form Arupako Rachmat04 Fadirra MartinNotified participants of WikiProject LanguageIn some languages such as Italian, French and German, nearly all proper names, occupations, nationalities and adjectives (maestro - maestra; lehrer - lehrerin; docteur - docteure; bianco - bianca) have a masculine and a feminine form. Currently, Wikidata has a lexeme for each form, but there's no link between one form and the other. What's the best solution: Create \"feminine form\", \"masculine form\" and \"neutral form\" properties to link one form to the other; Create only one lexeme for such words and point out the masculine and feminine forms in the Forms section. Lore.mazza81 (talk) 00:09, 26 August 2019 (UTC) You yourself used the term \"form\" to describe the differences, so it seems clear to me they should be considered different \"forms\" of the same lexeme. There may of course be other opinions on this. If somebody has a good reference, I'm sure this has been discussed in the lexicographical community! ArthurPSmith (talk) 17:33, 26 August 2019 (UTC) @Lore.mazza81: Swedish has two, three or four \"forms\" depending on how you define the model. Add to that \"gender-free form\", which is none of these four (or was is five?). I would therefor prefer a property with the label \"form\" where you could add whatever you like of any form there could be in the wide world. IP 62.20.170.74 (Hej!) 19:51, 26 August 2019 (UTC) @ArthurPSmith: I prefer this option, too. It seems to me the best one also because it makes easier to use the \"translation\" property in the case of words that have no gender in a language, but many of them in another. For example, the english word \"white\" can be translated as \"blanco\" and \"blanca\" in spanish, as \"bianco\" and \"bianca\" in Italian, as \"blanc\" and \"blanche\" in French, as \"weiß\" and \"weiß\" in German... @Sextvå.tvånoll.ettsjunoll.sjufyra: What's the difference between what you propose and the \"Forms\" section?--Lore.mazza81 (talk) 01:07, 27 August 2019 (UTC) I'm not sure if the samples from different lexical categories of random languages are really equivalent. Translations would generally be between specific senses of lexemes. Some languages have countless forms for most words, so you can't easily define them in the same way as in other languages. It should be possible to find an equivalence between languages independently of the chosen approach. --- Jura 02:40, 27 August 2019 (UTC) @Lore.mazza81: My main point is that linking to the feminine form by a specific property does not make much sense. Then you have to create a new property for all forms there are in the universe. As I said, Swedish has more forms than only \"feminine\", \"masculine\" and \"neutral\". When I was in school, we learned four forms, the forth was a \"second neutral\" form. My sister learned two forms: neutral and \"non-neutral\". In practise we today use a \"gender-free\" form that isn't neutral. That expands your model of three new properties to six only by expanding into one single language. IP 62.20.170.74 (Hej!) 08:41, 27 August 2019 (UTC) @Sextvå.tvånoll.ettsjunoll.sjufyra: I don't like the property approach either. @Jura1: In my opinion the spanish words \"blanco\" and \"blanca\" are different forms of the same lexeme, whose sense (or at lease one of its senses) is equivalent to (one of) the sense of the English lexeme \"white\". On the other hand, if we consider \"blanco\" and \"blanca\" two different lexemes (the current approach), none of their senses can be considered equivalent to any sense of the \"white\" lexeme.--Lore.mazza81 (talk) 02:31, 29 August 2019 (UTC) I'd think Spanish would make just one entity for this adjective. We probably didn't quite get to the point to seek a way to flag senses of adjectives that apply to just some of the forms. --- Jura 08:14, 29 August 2019 (UTC) Merger request (kind of) There are two (2) overlapping items, Q1045852 and Q10809927, the former includes any articles in various language and the latter only the Vietnamese-language article w:vi:Quan (tiền), well \"Quan (tiền)\" is about the currency unit \"String of cash coins\", going down the list of articles from the item \"Q1045852\", the German, Lithuanian, and Korean articles are exclusively about the \"貫\" weight measurement unit used for cultured pearls, while the English, Mandarin, and Japanese are all primarily about the currency unit, but also fully explain what the unit of mass is. Obviously the Vietnamese article should be in the same list as the English, Mandarin, and Japanese articles as well as the Wikimedia Commons (Commonswiki) article while the German, Lithuanian, and Korean language articles are about a concept which is mentioned in all other articles except for the Vietnamese one.While the simplest solution would be merging these two items, the scope of the articles overlap in some cases, but not in others, what would be the best solution here?Maybe the English, Mandarin, and Japanese Wikipedia's should have separate articles for the weight unit, but this seems to be a bit more complicated than that. -- Donald Trung/徵國單 (討論 🀄) (方孔錢 💴) 19:29, 28 August 2019 (UTC)In theory the Japanese language article could become a disambiguation and be split into the articles \"w:jp:貫文\" and \"w:jp:貫目\", the same could also happen on the English language article and the Mandarin one (which contains the least information on the Japanese unit used in the cultured pearl-industrial complex). -- Donald Trung/徵國單 (討論 🀄) (方孔錢 💴) 19:33, 28 August 2019 (UTC) Interesting topic. We can not force Wikipedias to split or merge articles, it depends only their own policy and the size of the content in that language. To me it sounds like a valid case for merging, provided we specify the right instance/subclass statements. Cheers!

For died after x-time you can use century precision for the century in which someone died and then use earliest date (P1319) which the earliest date. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 09:22, 29 August 2019 (UTC) Is there some particular help page where this is explained? - Jmabel (talk) 15:04, 29 August 2019 (UTC) Help:Dates#Qualifiers. --Matěj Suchánek (talk) 15:24, 29 August 2019 (UTC) Storing in Wikidata the preferred language variant used on Wikipedia? Hi all,I was asked a question by User:Boshomi that I’m not too sure about, so relaying here :)On the German-language Wikipedia, editors decide when an article should use Austrian German (Q306626) spelling, and add it to a tracking category (Q32078103) − that’s about 17K articles.(Worth noting that this use-case is not specific to German-language Wikipedia − English-language Wikipedia also has Category:Wikipedia articles by national variety of English (Q8110126))User:Boshomi was wondering whether it would be possible to somehow store that information on Wikidata. It would then be possible to use that information on the article (for example for formatting the dates automatically in Citation templates, as I understand it).As I understand it, whether an article 'should' use Austrian-German spelling is not something that can easily be inferred from the already existing properties (such as country (P17) or country of citizenship (P27)) − it’s an editorial decision made by the editing community based on several factors. It would then need to be stored as its own thing.On the face of it, my first thought was that we store here statements about the entities, not about the Wikipedia articles about it (except for the Badges). That said, we do have several Wikidata property about Wikimedia entities (Q51118821). So I am relaying the question here in order to get a more definite answer :)Thanks, Jean-Fred (talk) 16:29, 28 August 2019 (UTC) To clarify the use case: that information is stored Wikipedia-side using tracking categories, but this is not accessible from other templates used on the page − or at least it’s not clear how to do so: maybe there is some Lua function to do exactly that :) Jean-Fred (talk) 16:37, 28 August 2019 (UTC) I looked for a lua function and for magic words, but I could find nothing. The easy way is invoke a property from wikidata. –Boshomi (talk) 18:03, 28 August 2019 (UTC) It seems to me like an editorial decision made at dewiki based on dewiki policy that only concerns dewiki (other Wikis might make different decisions about how a name is supposed to be spelled). Such information seems to me like it's ideally stored in a dewiki tracking category and not on Wikidata. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 09:27, 29 August 2019 (UTC) @ChristianKl: Yes, it is an property of a dewiki article. The tracking category exits Q32078103. The use case for wikidata is template programming: if invoke dewikiLang=de-AT then Jänner else Januar end
 if invoke dewikiLang=de-CH then replace(sometextwith_ß , ß, ss) end The result is a text output of templates that fits to the article, and there is no need for editing tousends of articles to put same extra parameter into each templates transclution.–Boshomi (talk) 18:03, 29 August 2019 (UTC) May be these wikis should create appropriate \"badges\" which could be assigned to such articles? --Infovarius (talk) 20:14, 29 August 2019 (UTC) Modeling the ratings and reviews of critics Is anyone aware of a precedent for general modeling of quality ratings and reviews by critics?Expert organizations and commentators routinely rate and review media, places, products, and organizations. Here are some examples: book review (Q637866) - rates new books consumer organization (Q1329436) - rates consumer products like toasters, dishwashers, and sunscreen literary criticism (Q58854) - is an academic field which presents commentary on all sorts of media book review (Q637866) - rates environmental factors, like public access to parks content rating (Q5165090) - media suitability ratings Every big budget, book, music collection, video game, and movie gets critic ratings from lots of publications. In academia all sorts of individuals, organizations, and journals rate and review everything that is the subject of human discourse. Citizens, corporate entities, and government rate and review each other continually.What discussion already exists about bringing this into Wikidata? I am especially interested in brief ratings, either numbers on a scale, a grade, single words, or a generalization like pass/fail. Let's put complex ratings and reviews, like essays, aside for now. Possible paths forward Have Wikidata properties for every sort of rating Seems unlikely as there are endless rating systems and the majority are small datasets of <100 ratings Have some general property which we adapt with qualifiers Perhaps we match this with identifiers, as many ratings are from data collections? Something else? Thanks. More than anything, I wish for anyone to speak up if they remember or can point to any previous or ongoing conversation. Blue Rasberry (talk) 14:14, 29 August 2019 (UTC) Hi Bluerasberry. I can give an overview of how things are done for video game (Q7889). The current status is captured at Wikidata:WikiProject_Video_games/Properties#Reception_properties: content rating (Q5165090): we have properties for all(?) rating systems ; for some there is a rating certificate ID (P2676) used as qualifier. Reviews: still a budding area: Either directly on the game-item, using review score (P444) ; see for example Q83265#P444, and some statistics or using items for the review, linked to the game via review of (P6977), and potentially tagged with genre (P136)→video game review (Q61992233) (very little use so far [1]) Hope that helps, Jean-Fred (talk) 14:56, 29 August 2019 (UTC)[1]SELECT ?review ?game ?gameLabel WHERE {

Snipre (talk) 08:14, 28 August 2019 (UTC) Physican here but a physicist would be more appropriate in this case ;-) Kpjas (talk) 08:35, 28 August 2019 (UTC) @Snipre: I'm a physicist - though the properties on deuteron (Q27459116) look more like a chemistry point of view. But both items are about the same fundamental object, so it seems fine to me to merge them. ArthurPSmith (talk) 18:11, 28 August 2019 (UTC) I thought deuterium is an atom, and a deuteron is a nucleus of deuterium - meaning they have for example different mass?--Ymblanter (talk) 19:03, 28 August 2019 (UTC) deuterium is an atom or isotope, yes. But the 1+ ion is missing its electron, so it's only the nucleus. ArthurPSmith (talk) 20:30, 28 August 2019 (UTC) I thought deuterium is a (chemical) substance while deutron is a type of nucleus. --Infovarius (talk) 20:16, 29 August 2019 (UTC) Done Snipre (talk) 07:48, 30 August 2019 (UTC) Missing items from WLM lists on itwikipedia Hi, I am working with User:Giaccai on WLM lists for Tuscany and since one week we have been having problems with bizzare Listeriabot removal on itwikipedia. Some of these items were previously indexed but are not \"seen\" now by the system. For example this removal is where Piazza San Francesco (Q63982735) suddenly disappeared, few days ago it was only those items (that are still regularly removed if inserted). So it's hetting worse, apparently. Today we cannot insert almost anything from the civil parish of Vernio, at the bottom of the list example. We have similar situation in other local list but for some reason this is the worst one and it gives you a clear idea just in one place. I have however no clue why this happens so far, mostly because I have few time to analyze it. I hoped it would just naturally disappear...The Italian community gave no resolutive answer by email so... any advice? It's not about local null edits or something like that. I also massively edits the items on various details just to be sure it could unblock something, it's not related to warning signs such as for example missing commons categories... One troubleshooting test I did not perform is to see if the problem is also on other wikipedias, I could do this as well but we are busy with hundreds of items to insert during these last days, i hope somebody can give me some advice before September, 1st. Otherwise the only temporary solution we have is to insert them manually every day to see them removed...--Alexmar983 (talk) 15:42, 30 August 2019 (UTC) I think Q63982735 disappeared as the item was merged the day before with another item that was already in the list. --- Jura 15:51, 30 August 2019 (UTC) Q66828154 is excluded from the query as P2186 has an end date. [24] --- Jura 16:02, 30 August 2019 (UTC) but if the end date is this year, it should be excluded next year. i can try to put an end date and strat date together, it this is how is encoded.--Alexmar983 (talk) 16:04, 30 August 2019 (UTC) No let's try point in time.--Alexmar983 (talk) 16:07, 30 August 2019 (UTC) ok now it works but I am not sure it's formally encoded correctly. For example if my WLM code is valid from year 2014 to 2019 (up to the end of the town council, as it could happen... I cannot encode it as \"start date=2014, end date=2018\", plus \"point date=2019\". it should be able to understand that end date implies the removal from the following year...--Alexmar983 (talk) 16:12, 30 August 2019 (UTC) Maybe [25] or [26] works excludes the ones you are interested. The second query takes in account date precision. --- Jura 16:44, 30 August 2019 (UTC) Don't worry, they are done manually to fix all minor details including external ID and commons category, so we know them quite well. we spot if a code is missing in the list. Thank you for the queries BTW, they might useful in other regions if they also refine this qualifier as we start to do (but still, this upper limit should not be encoded this way, when we say the last year we clearly include it).--Alexmar983 (talk) 17:16, 30 August 2019 (UTC) Jura I still have doubts... I wish I had more times but WLM sucks a lot of energy with the social media campaign and reply to civil servants, I just try to do my best with some clear instruction and understand later. So if you have time to help me consider Calcinaia, I put \"point in time 2019\", as it should be and now it's gone. But I am quite it was not like that last year, I put \"point in time\" 2018 to at least one case, and they were listed. I might be tired but I feel something is different. You changed the code here right? They did modify something, maybe a comparison might show some clue. I am sorry i am just too full of stuff to process urgently to understand it right now.
