 Try it! The logical thing would be to think that the first result should be Alpha Centauri A (Q2090157) (since it is the closest to Earth), but in reality is COSMOS2015 489026 (Q75031832) which is 0.15 kiloparsec. Is there any way to detect the distances expressed in parsec and kiloparsec to convert them to light years? Otherwise, the distance from Earth (P2583) should be added in each star both in light years and in (kilo)parsecs and choose from the query which to use.--190.139.216.64 02:25, 20 February 2020 (UTC) There are two possibilities. One is the built-in normalization of units: # Stars up to 18 light years away sorted by the nearest

 Try it! I have limited both queries to 100 results before sorting because theywill timeout without a limit. There are 1,542,325 stars in Wikidata. I think it is impossible to search them all and convert the units in 60 seconds using SPARQL. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 05:15, 20 February 2020 (UTC) The most time-consuming part of the queries is the FILTER function (when removed its run almost instantaneously). Ideally, all these distances (light-year (Q531), parsec (Q12129), kiloparsec (Q11929860) and megaparsec (Q3773454)) should be stored in the database instead of being calculated on the fly and that everyone chooses the unit they prefer, I think that would improve the execution times of the query.--190.139.216.64 13:18, 20 February 2020 (UTC) Probably it's better to use \"wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q523\" as not all the stars have preferred \"Q523\" value. Also do you want e.g. brown dwarf (Q101600) (one is very close to the Sun)? They are even technically not stars... --Infovarius (talk) 10:14, 3 March 2020 (UTC) Most common kinds of items and what are the most common statements for them? I want to write some instructions for new contributors Hi allI'm not sure exactly what query I'm looking for but I'm working on schemas and other instructions for new contributors and I really like some information on common kinds of items so I know what people want to work on. What I would like to know is what are the most common 'kinds' of items are, as these, I guessing, are probably what they will want to create an item for. I guess this could be measured in a couple of different ways Most common statements overall (this will be useful for quick instructions for themed editathons etc) Most common 'instance of' Other very common statements and the most common values for those statements I assume there are a lot of people on Wikidata, to break this down a bit, what are the most common statements for people and what are the most common values? Once there's a list of the most common 'kinds' of items what are the most common statements for them e.g What are the most common statements for scientists? (I assume the professional would be more granular than 'scientist' but would have very similar instructions to create Thanks very much--John Cummings (talk) 19:56, 28 February 2020 (UTC) @John Cummings: There's some statistics info at the bottom of Wikidata:Statistics, and you can get an idea of common properties for kinds of items from the WD:Recoin tool. --Yair rand (talk) 19:51, 2 March 2020 (UTC) Weird football statistics (2 queries) I just added full individual statistics for the UEFA Super Cup (Q484028) (example1example2).

I can easily write a query for Nigerian women without an image on Wikidata, but not a query for Wikipedia biographies without image. There may be other tools which can do that, but I cannot help with that. Maybe others can. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 19:34, 2 March 2020 (UTC) Items used: Nigeria (Q1033)   , female (Q6581072)   Properties used: country of citizenship (P27)   , place of birth (P19)   , country (P17)   , place of death (P20)   , sex or gender (P21)   , image (P18)   """@en;
