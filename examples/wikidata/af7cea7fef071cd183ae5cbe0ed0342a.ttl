Web interface just throws \"Server error\", requesting via HTTP GET in C# program hits URL size limit (64k). Trying to send request via POST results in 405 error: [1]. But, according to mw:Wikidata query service/User Manual#SPARQL endpoint and closed phab:T112151, POST requests should be supported. Maybe I am doing something wrong? — Vort (talk) 10:29, 3 May 2017 (UTC) Also no luck with wget: \"ERROR 414: Request-URI Too Large\". — Vort (talk) 11:02, 3 May 2017 (UTC) Sorry, but I don't know how to work around that. Perhaps you could make the batches smaller. Or you can ask someone on the chat. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 11:06, 3 May 2017 (UTC) If you're able to mark items with one property (the same) or if all of them share common parent, you could do this. d1g (talk) 17:25, 3 May 2017 (UTC) I was able to make a POST request after adjusting HTTP headers and body. 405 error was not on its place. — Vort (talk) 04:46, 4 May 2017 (UTC) Query to get locations of wikidata items with article names Hello! I'm interested in working on cross checking data between (various) wikipedias and OpenStreetMap. I've been using the mediawiki API, but there's limitations as to what you can fetch (see mediawiki-api list). I'd like to see whether I can get the data using a wikidata query instead. However, I'm completely new to SPARQL, and would really appreciate some help. Query 1 My objective is to retrieve all geolocated entries (wikidata, wikipedias etc) in a rectangular area (specified by two lat/lon pairs), so that these can be compared to what OpenStreetMap has in that area. Using the wiki data service, is this possible? (I've come across cases where a wikidata item didn't have coordinates, but one of the language wikipedias did. So this would be the ideal query.) Wikidata items would need to include claims ( including coordinates and commons category), while wikipedia items would need to contain coordinates, categories, wikidata item, and wikipedia language links. Alternative However, if that's not possible, then I'd like to retrieve all wikidata items in a rectangle, together with the corresponding wikipedia pages. For each wikidata item, I would like to retrieve the data as just described, e.g. suppose Q1034758 is in the rectangle, then I would like to retrieve The item itself Q1034758 (with all claims, including coordinates and commons category) together with whatever language wikipedias there are, i.e. in this case: ca:Poblat_talaiòtic_de_Capocorb_Vell (ideally together with coordinates and categories on ca.wikipedia.org) de:Talaiotische_Siedlung_von_Capocorb_Vell en:Capocorb_Vell es:Capocorb_Vell I'd like to output in JSON. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

 Try it! which lists item and used point in time (P585) as qualifier for Elo rating (P1087). But the query seems to be pretty slow (with limit 100 it took approx. 15 seconds to execute).

If you don't need the label, just erase it and you will immediately get a list of 100 items.

 Try it! It would be nice to add to the above (as an output column) what the item is a direct instance of (1+), and to limit it by an industry property.Is there any property inheritance?

YoavR (talk) 17:13, 25 May 2017 (UTC) Role-playing game This is my first time working with wikidata, but I am familiar with SQL. What I would like to do is basically this: select \"label\", \"developer\", \"publisher\", \"publication date\"
from \"video game\"
where \"genre\" includes \"role-playing video game\" Here is an example record. Note how there are multiple possible genres. How would I form this script? Thanks! SharkD (talk) 04:07, 24 May 2017 (UTC) SELECT ?game ?gameLabel ?devLabel ?publisherLabel ?date WHERE {

 Try it! Sjoerd de Bruin (talk) 14:51, 25 May 2017 (UTC) How do I pull the references as well? Thanks. SharkD (talk) 16:25, 25 May 2017 (UTC) I will try and figure it out. SharkD (talk) 19:53, 25 May 2017 (UTC) Items in category without class What is a standard way to obtain a list of articles in a certain category without P31 or P279? Because using both \"categories and sparql\"+noclaim[31] or \"categories not sparql\"+claim[31] times out: https://petscan.wmflabs.org/?psid=1047719&al_commands=P31%3AQ6999. --Infovarius (talk) 12:25, 24 May 2017 (UTC) I usually use 'uses items/props' field in Wikidata tab (or whatever it was called). --Edgars2007 But I want those which don't use props! --Infovarius (talk) 15:32, 25 May 2017 (UTC) You can choose \"any\", \"all\" or \"none\". Sjoerd de Bruin (talk) 15:37, 25 May 2017 (UTC) Oh, what an inadvertence from me! And thank you both. --Infovarius (talk) 12:41, 26 May 2017 (UTC) Fill in empty table fields I have this query: SELECT ?gameLabel ?devLabel ?publisherLabel ?dateLabel WHERE {

 Try it! Is there a way I can fill in missing fields into the result set table like I can in SQL Server and MySQL Workbench? It would make things a lot quicker and easier. Thanks. SharkD (talk) 23:15, 25 May 2017 (UTC) No, it is not possible to add missing fields in the result table. But you can make use of quickstatements, a very quick way to enter lots of data at the same item. And here are the commands you can use, but this tool is outdated: https://tools.wmflabs.org/wikidata-todo/quick_statements.php. Q.Zanden questions? 12:04, 26 May 2017 (UTC) @SharkD: you can do such things in Tabernacle. --Infovarius (talk) 12:44, 26 May 2017 (UTC) Thanks! SharkD (talk) 16:45, 26 May 2017 (UTC) National Heads of Government redux If I want to generate a list of every country, and the finance minister (Q7614320)-level position in them (with blanks where none exist), I can do this fairly simply with: SELECT DISTINCT ?country ?countryLabel ?office ?officeLabel 
WHERE {    
  ?country wdt:P31 wd:Q6256 .            # for all countries
  OPTIONAL {
    ?office wdt:P279* wd:Q7614320 ;        #   find any subclass of \"finance minister\"
            wdt:P1001 ?country .           #   with that jurisdiction
  }
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\" . }
}
ORDER BY ?countryLabel ?officeLabel
 Try it! However, if it try to do the equivalent with head of government (Q2285706) it times out: SELECT DISTINCT ?country ?countryLabel ?office ?officeLabel 
WHERE {    
  ?country wdt:P31 wd:Q6256 .            # for all countries
  OPTIONAL {
    ?office wdt:P279* wd:Q2285706 ;        #   find any subclass of \"head of government\"
            wdt:P1001 ?country .           #   with that jurisdiction
  }
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\" . }
}
ORDER BY ?countryLabel ?officeLabel
 Try it! The non-OPTIONAL version works fine. Is there a better way to express this, or some way to optimise it? (I'm aware that I can take other routes, including via office held by head of government (P1313), but those get different results, and one of the goals here is to find places where the information is inconsistent depending on which fields are filled in on which items). --Oravrattas (talk) 13:18, 26 May 2017 (UTC) Query the enwiki article link?

  	OPTIONAL {

 Try it! Is it possible to get a link to the Wikidata and enWiki pages of each item in the Wikidata Query result set? Thanks. SharkD (talk) 17:39, 26 May 2017 (UTC) You get the Wikidata link simply by including ?game in the first part of your SELECT statement, i.e. SELECT ?game ?gameLabel ?devLabel etc. MartinPoulter (talk) 19:57, 26 May 2017 (UTC) You get the enWiki link with this clause: OPTIONAL{ ?enwiki schema:about ?game ; schema:isPartOf <https://en.wikipedia.org/> } Remember to add ?enwiki to the first part of your SELECT statement. MartinPoulter (talk) 19:58, 26 May 2017 (UTC) Very good thanks. Is it possible to collapse the links down to just a few characters? For instance, \"Link\". SharkD (talk) 22:24, 26 May 2017 (UTC) @SharkD: Do you mean you just want the enwiki article title, or that you want a small string that's actually linked to the enwiki article? Items with a certain property and identical (en) descriptions I'm trying to write a query which finds all items with Oxford Dictionary of National Biography ID (P1415) and identifies all the ones which have exactly the same description text in English. This will help me find and fix a few hundred which were imported with incorrect descriptions (items are often paired, and the desciption for one got used for both). However, the query I tried timed out: SELECT DISTINCT ?item1 ?item1Label ?description1 ?item2 ?item2Label ?description2
{
	?item1 wdt:P1415 ?odnb1 .
	?item2 wdt:P1415 ?odnb2 .
    ?item1 schema:description ?description1 .
    ?item2 schema:description ?description2 .
    FILTER(LANG(?description1) = \"en\").
    FILTER(LANG(?description2) = \"en\").
	SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\" } .
	FILTER(?item1 != ?item2  && str(?description1) = str(?description2)) .
} LIMIT 50
 Try it! Is there a way I can make this more efficient? If it helps to narrow down the space a bit, all the offending descriptions are likely to have a set of brackets () in them. Andrew Gray (talk) 10:41, 27 May 2017 (UTC) SELECT DISTINCT ?description1 ?item1 ?item1Label ?item2 ?item2Label
{
	{	SELECT DISTINCT ?item1 ?description1 ?item2

    		?item1 schema:description ?description1 .
    		?item2 schema:description ?description1 .
    		FILTER(LANG(?description1) = \"en\" && ?item1 != ?item2 && str(?item1) < str(?item2)  ) .
		}
		LIMIT 1000
	}
  	SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }
}
 Try it! The above works. Limiting it to ?description1 wasn't sufficient to get it to work faster. --- Jura 10:50, 27 May 2017 (UTC) On, wonderful! Hadn't realised I could do both descriptions with the same value. And based on that I can add a text filter: SELECT DISTINCT ?description1 ?item1 ?item1Label ?item2 ?item2Label
{
	{	SELECT DISTINCT ?item1 ?description1 ?item2
		{
			?item1 wdt:P1415 ?whatever1 .
			?item2 wdt:P1415 ?whatever2 .
    		?item1 schema:description ?description1 .
    		?item2 schema:description ?description1 .
    		FILTER(LANG(?description1) = \"en\" && ?item1 != ?item2 && str(?item1) < str(?item2)  ) .
            FILTER (CONTAINS(str(?description1),'('))
		}
		LIMIT 1000
	}
  	SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }

Andrew Gray (talk) 11:09, 27 May 2017 (UTC) Amount of artists in Wikidata per year  We would like to show the amount of artists added in Wikidata for each month, so that you can see in a graph how much artists are contributed to wikidata in the previous years. Is that possible to create? --Hannolans (talk) 06:27, 21 May 2017 (UTC) If you are looking for the number of newly created items about \"artists\", there is currently no straightforward way to do that. https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T151539 asks for adding the creation date of an item. You could try to do a rough estimate by using the QID of an item and evaluate which month this relates to. Maybe there is a way to do it in SQL. Also, the chart on the right does an approximation for taxa. --- Jura 10:46, 29 May 2017 (UTC) Get items of any type with a given label I'd like to pass a text string and get a list of things for which it is an English label (ideally with a case-insensitive match). For example, when I give \"cancer\" as input, I'd like it to return cancer (Q12078), Cancer (Q8849), Cancer (Q161701) Cancer (Q428243) and so on, just like when I type the word in the Wikidata search box. Any query I try to do this will time out. SELECT ?thing ?name
WHERE
{ ?thing rdfs:label ?name FILTER(lang(?name)=\"en\") FILTER(?name=\"cancer\")
} LIMIT 10
 Try it! Maybe WQS is the wrong tool for this? Any help welcome.P.S. I looked at the list of showcase queries, and found this which tries to do something similar and also times out. MartinPoulter (talk) 19:56, 26 May 2017 (UTC) SELECT ?thing ?name WHERE {
  BIND( STRLANG( 'cancer', 'en' ) AS ?name ) .
  ?thing rdfs:label ?name .
}
 Try it! Matěj Suchánek (talk) 20:08, 26 May 2017 (UTC) @Matěj Suchánek: That works well and quickly, thanks. Is there a way to make it case-insensitive? MartinPoulter (talk) 06:31, 28 May 2017 (UTC) Not that I know now. You need to have set of labels with different case: SELECT ?thing ?name WHERE {
  VALUES ?name { 'cancer'@en 'Cancer'@en } .
  ?thing rdfs:label ?name .
}
 Try it! I also simplified the syntax. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 09:23, 28 May 2017 (UTC) Grouping I'm trying to get this (experimental) code to work: SELECT ?game (group_concat(distinct ?gameLabel ; separator = \",\") AS ?propset) WHERE {

    wdt:P136 wd:Q744038.
    SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }
} group by $game
 Try it! For some reason propset is always empty. This seems to happen with many of the \"labels\" for other parameters and such. What do I need to change to fix it? SharkD (talk) 06:15, 28 May 2017 (UTC) Items used: video game (Q7889)   , role-playing video game (Q744038)   Properties used: instance of (P31)   , genre (P136)   SELECT ?game (group_concat(distinct str(?gameLabel) ; separator = \",\") AS ?propset) WHERE {
    ?game wdt:P31 wd:Q7889;

  	?game rdfs:label ?gameLabel
    # SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en,es,ja,ru\". ?game rdfs:label ?gameLabel }
} group by $game Try it! I think ?gameLabel may need to be set explicitly, either in the service or without. The above works. --- Jura 06:22, 28 May 2017 (UTC) Jura1 The results are not \"distinct\". I get a lot of repeated strings. It seems to be listing everything. Actually I'm not sure what is happening.SharkD (talk) 06:32, 28 May 2017 (UTC) I had omitted \"str()\" in the initial version. As label includes the language code, this lead to repetitions. --- Jura 08:01, 28 May 2017 (UTC) @Jura1:, I am actually trying to concatenate the game genre and some other parameters.
