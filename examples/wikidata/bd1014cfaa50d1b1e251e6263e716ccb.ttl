I read about the group_concat bug, added 2 variables for grouping but it breaks anyway. I bet you see the problem in a second. Another open issue is the image, I know I've seen an example where the output was limited on 1 value, but I cannot find it. #defaultView:Map

LIMIT 300 Try it!@Elya: I tried to fix it above. \"Query is malformed: Bad aggregate\" means that in SELECT you have unaggregated variables that are missing in \"GROUP BY\". Somewhere further down, it lists one ( \"Non-aggregate variable in select expression: coords\"). It's an error message I get frequently ;) I also changed the year and the image output to list just one. --- Jura 21:26, 1 March 2021 (UTC) Jura, aaaah, yes, I see. Thanks! I'll see what else I can do with my little dataset ;-) And I promise I'll read the error message stacks next time … --Elya (talk) 21:52, 1 March 2021 (UTC) @Elya: Your query select items that received Kölner Architekturpreis (Q1795794) and that received some unspecified award on some point of time. It can both be the same award and two different awards. You probably mean ?item p:P166 [ps:P166 wd:Q1795794; a wikibase:BestRank; pq:P585 ?date]. so the point of time is when Kölner Architekturpreis (Q1795794) is received and not some other award. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 22:13, 1 March 2021 (UTC) @Elya: Another thing: The query has the comment ?item wdt:P18 ?img. # might be more than one. I want the first one. There is no order of statements in Wikidata, so no image can be called \"the first\".

 Try it! --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 10:52, 4 March 2021 (UTC) Dipsacus fullonum Excellent doing a query like this is out of scope for me Thanks. I changed the query/image to find Wikicommons pictures missing a depict to the WD object they are image (P18)... I am trying to convince the people over at Evighetsrunor to use \"Rune pictures\" from Wikicommons and hopefully they will download the pictures and quality assure them and that they will have an unique persistent picture id and also quality assure the \"depict\" i.e. that we in Structured data on Wikimedia Commons has same as \"the Evighetsrunor picture id\" and that they confirm that the picture depicts the same Rune as we depict... the future will tell if we convince them GITHUB... - Salgo60 (talk) 13:46, 4 March 2021 (UTC) 20 criteria for 2 or 3 focus languages Could be interesting to have a query that finds the language(s) described in Wikidata:Lexicographical data/Focus languages/Requirements. --- Jura 07:45, 4 March 2021 (UTC) I can imagine easily a query that finds languages that finds candidates. Finding (a) set(s) of candidates is beyond what can be easily done in sparql because it would require something like an « alldiff » constraint ( https://web.imt-atlantique.fr/x-info/sdemasse/gccat/Calldifferent.html — can be written but not succintly or easily). Some of the criteria seems also hard to capture ( « The group has at least two members who can communicate in English and who are willing to be the long-term communication facilitators. » for example) Seems impossible to do here, I don’t think we even have informations like community size (do we?). author TomT0m / talk page 11:42, 4 March 2021 (UTC) Some should be possible. Here are two criteria partially: Items used: Wikipedia language edition (Q10876391)   , English (Q1860)   Properties used: instance of (P31)   , language of work or name (P407)   , number of speakers, writers, or signers (P1098)   """@en;
