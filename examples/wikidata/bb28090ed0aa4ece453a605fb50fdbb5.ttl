Could anyone help me please? My query is here.--Odanoburu (talk) 19:05, 5 December 2017 (UTC)[reply] Women scientists from Scotland [edit] Hi there, I am trying to put together a SPARQL query that lists women from Scotland who worked in the field of science. I've tried to put together a query based on some of the other examples that use place of origin and profession, but it isn't working. --004dot678 (talk) 10:10, 12 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] Hi, this should be quite a simple query in principle, but it takes too long to run and times out for me unless I try to do something more than the usual simple approach. Here is a query that does the trick, with a some explanation there to try and explain the steps. Bear in mind that you will have multiple results for the same person with this query (e.g. when they have multiple occupations), let me know if you need anything else done to it :) NavinoEvans (talk) 14:52, 12 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] Logical \"or\" [edit] In SPARQL the dot is used for a logical \"and\" meaning that both statements (the one before and the one after the dot) should be true. I'm looking for a logical \"or\". So for me it is enough that one statement is true. Consider this example. I tried to solve it with a union. But this results in a table where we get more than one line for many films. In case a film has a Kinopolis ID and a Cineplex ID I want both ids entered in the same line and no further line for this film. --Jobu0101 (talk) 08:10, 13 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] I could solve the problem with a nested query: [1]. But I'm still interested if there is an easier solution without the use of nested queries. --Jobu0101 (talk) 08:15, 13 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] Maybe #Optional and Group by will be OK to you? --Edgars2007 (talk) 08:17, 13 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] @Edgars2007: Your link helped me. I think that's a good solution even though I didn't group: [2]. --Jobu0101 (talk) 08:26, 13 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] @Edgars2007: I just found out that those queries only list films with a Kinopolis ID. Can you explain why for example Marshland (Q18145311) is not listed? --Jobu0101 (talk) 08:33, 13 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] \"||\" works for properties directly. --- Jura 08:39, 13 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] As this didn't return anything for Marshland (Q18145311), I would say, that query is OK, data are outdated. I did a purge on film item, but that won't work, right? --Edgars2007 (talk) 08:45, 13 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] @Edgars2007: No, it seems to be a SPARQL bug. See [3]. --Jobu0101 (talk) 09:36, 13 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] Strange. Unless it comes from another server. @Smalyshev (WMF), Smalyshev (WMDE): would you check? --- Jura 09:43, 13 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] There are currently 41 films which serve as example: [4]. Once you allow OPTIONAL{?film wdt:P2970 ?kinopolis} to be part of the query all results are gone. So I don't think that it's a data/server problem. It's a SPARQL bug or we misunderstand the meaning of the query. --Jobu0101 (talk) 11:29, 13 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] Interesting anomaly. I feel sorry that you get that many at once. --- Jura 11:38, 13 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] That query is even shorter: [5]. You only get results without the OPTIONAL statement. --Jobu0101 (talk) 11:33, 13 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] Interestingly, you get results also if you add some other statement before \"OPTIONAL\" unless this is ?film wdt:P2970|wdt:3077 [] . Maybe for once, the P-entity is broken. --- Jura 11:41, 13 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] None of your sample items has P2970. --- Jura 11:52, 13 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] @Jura1: I know. That's how I chose them because the problem occurs which such items. See also this post. --Jobu0101 (talk) 12:03, 13 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] If you invert P2970 and P3077, the other ones are missing. Either the first \"OPTIONAL\" doesn't work as I expect it or I'm not using it in the way I should. --- Jura 12:07, 13 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] I think OPTIONAL should come after the VALUES. See this: https://wiki.blazegraph.com/wiki/index.php/SPARQL_Order_Matters . Basically if you start with OPTIONAL, you get only the results which OPTIONAL captures. --Smalyshev (WMF) (talk) 22:26, 16 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] Somehow it fails also when one starts with ?film wdt:P2970|wdt:3077 [] . --- Jura 22:41, 16 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] QUERY TIMEOUT problem [edit] Is there a way to make this query work? --Jobu0101 (talk) 10:11, 18 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] This one also times-out. With uncommented limit, it works. --Edgars2007 (talk) 10:38, 18 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] Note, that you (I assume) had errors - mixing up ?film and ?item etc. --Edgars2007 (talk) 10:40, 18 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] Thank you very much. And you were right. I was mixing up ?film and ?item. If I extend the prefix by a higher digit it also works: [6]. But it doesn't for tt0 since there are too many matches. --Jobu0101 (talk) 11:03, 18 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] strstarts might be more efficient. --- Jura 12:32, 18 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] Not effective enough: [7]. But thanks anyway. I didn't know that function and it's good to learn about faster functions. --Jobu0101 (talk) 12:55, 18 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] Indeed: getting the labels in a second steps works better: [8] --- Jura 13:02, 18 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] Great and thank you so much. This is the first query posted here which actually answers my original question. --Jobu0101 (talk) 13:57, 18 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] Sounds logical to get labels after grouping. In this way you need to get them for very low number of items :) --Edgars2007 (talk) 15:24, 18 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] It runs slightly faster if you just test for \"t\". --- Jura 15:32, 18 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] Filter doesn't work [edit] I'm concerned about this query: PREFIX p: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/>

About deleting - it is kind of against non written rules, but I personally don't mind, if you delete it. And your query doesn't seem to have some unique way of doing things, which is important on this page for learning. --Edgars2007 (talk) 20:28, 18 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] Why does this query timeout whereas with a filter it does not ?

It's unfortunate that blazegraph is so sensitive to the way the query is written however :/ . I know solvers in over computing fields that would not be (http://choco-solver.org/ for example ) ... not designed to work with knowledge based but still.

 Try it! I'm trying to have this output one row per language and a column for every country. Is there a way to do it without defining a variable manually for each country ? -- Jura 07:35, 28 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] Probably not, that would mean you have to do the projection on a list of variable. Maybe by constructing a list or a graph in the sparql, but that would mean query.wikidata.org could render the constructed list (http://www.snee.com/bobdc.blog/2014/04/rdf-lists-and-sparql.html)/graph (https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/#construct) some way, in a table I guess if that's what you want, a feature I don't recall to have seen. author TomT0m / talk page 08:13, 28 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] Thanks.

[edit] Interesting feature: https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T141813 --- Jura 17:56, 30 August 2016 (UTC)[reply] How to use the wdno: (novalue) prefix and how to query with deprecated ranks [edit] Does someone know how a query could be created to find all items with a child (P40) of \"no value\". Could this query then be modified to find all items where this statement may be deprecated? This would allow someone to build a query which answers the question: How many humans were once believed to be childless, but have since been found to have had children?. I use child (P40) as an example only, and am not interested in solutions which use number of children (P1971). I haven't been able to understand how the wdno: prefix and deprecated ranks are used in queries, and believe an example of both features being used in a single query would be highly beneficial. Pixeldomain (talk) 01:15, 4 October 2016 (UTC)[reply] To answer my own question, this query finds childless humans: #humans who are childless
SELECT ?human ?humanName {
  ?human wdt:P31 wd:Q5 .
  ?human p:P40 ?childStatement .
  ?childStatement a wdno:P40 .
  OPTIONAL { ?human rdfs:label ?humanName filter (lang(?humanName) = \"en\") }
} LIMIT 100
 Try it! This query would then find humans who were once falsely believed to be childless (currently no results are returned): #humans who were once falseley believed to be childless
SELECT ?human ?humanName {
  ?human wdt:P31 wd:Q5 .
  ?human p:P40 ?childStatement .
  ?childStatement a wdno:P40 .
  ?childStatement wikibase:rank wikibase:DeprecatedRank .
  OPTIONAL { ?human rdfs:label ?humanName filter (lang(?humanName) = \"en\") }
} LIMIT 100

Sometimes queries return values like 't192923492' instead of the usual QID or a literal value. Why? Is this a bug? Emijrp (talk) 06:41, 6 October 2016 (UTC)[reply] No, it's not a bug. It means 'novalue' or 'somevalue' (don't remember, which of them and can't easily check). --Edgars2007 (talk) 11:26, 6 October 2016 (UTC)[reply] But it should return the value, because it was defined in Wikidata, and it wasn't a lag issue.

I have written the query below for it, but it is not working properly.. Could you help me out?

 Try it!  Mtmlan84 (talk) 12:59, 7 November 2016 (UTC)[reply] Artists with work in multiple museums [edit] @Multichill, Spinster: Can you help me out? Also in the light of using Wikidata as a GLAM tool to help out determining copyright status and contacting right holders, I would like a query that gives an overview of makers who's work is in multiple collections. For example a visual artist who's work is both in the collection of Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam and TATE London. Thank you so much! Mtmlan84 (talk) 17:04, 8 November 2016 (UTC)[reply] List humans that are not males or females [edit] I am trying to list - or event count humans (Q5) that do not have male (Q6581097) or female (Q6581072) gender. This should work, but it times out all the time. Is there a more efficient way to write the query? SELECT (COUNT(?human) as ?chuman)
WHERE
{
  ?human wdt:P31 wd:Q5 .
  FILTER ( !EXISTS{ ?human wdt:P21 wd:Q6581072 } && !EXISTS{ ?human wdt:P21 wd:Q6581097 })
}
 Try it! NB: I am aware about https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries/examples#People_of_whom_we_know_we_don.27t_know_their_gender but that is different because it lists only people who have no gender set. --Vacilandois (talk) 21:51, 9 November 2016 (UTC)[reply] Films without any 'Wikidata property for identification in the film industry' [edit] Hey guys! Can you explain to me why this query SELECT ?film WHERE {
  	?film wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q11424 .
    FILTER NOT EXISTS {?film ?prop ?value . ?prop wdt:P31 wd:Q22964274}
} LIMIT 10
 Try it! does not work the way I was expecting it to work? For example, we get We Live in Public (Q372) as result even though We Live in Public (Q372) has set the property IMDb ID (P345) which is a Wikidata property for identification in the film industry (Q22964274). --Jobu0101 (talk) 10:13, 26 November 2016 (UTC)[reply] SELECT ?film WHERE {

 Try it! --Edgars2007 (talk) 14:09, 26 November 2016 (UTC)[reply] Thank you. Can you explain the meaning of ?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p? --Jobu0101 (talk) 14:31, 26 November 2016 (UTC)[reply] Unfortunantely, I can't. You can read a little bit about it here. --Edgars2007 (talk) 16:03, 26 November 2016 (UTC)[reply] Select qualifier string content [edit] I have a query such as """@en;
