Just learning the SPARQL basics will get you a long way – even if you stop reading after #Our first query, you will already understand enough to construct many interesting queries. Each section of this tutorial will empower you to write even more powerful queries.If you have never heard of Wikidata, SPARQL, or WDQS before, here’s a short explanation of those terms: Wikidata is a knowledge database. It contains millions of statements, such as “the capital of Canada is Ottawa”, or “the Mona Lisa is painted in oil paint on poplar wood”, or “gold has a melting point of 1,064.18 degrees Celsius”. SPARQL is a language to formulate questions (queries) for knowledge databases. With the right database, a SPARQL query could answer questions like “what is the most popular tonality in music?” or “which character was portrayed by the most actors?” or “what’s the distribution of blood types?” or “which authors’ works entered the public domain this year?”. WDQS, the Wikidata Query Service, brings the two together: You enter a SPARQL query, it runs it against Wikidata’s dataset and shows you the result. SPARQL basics [edit] A simple SPARQL query looks like this: SELECT ?a ?b ?c
WHERE
{
  x y ?a.
  m n ?b.
  ?b f ?c.
} The SELECT clause lists variables that you want returned (variables start with a question mark), and the WHERE clause contains restrictions on them, mostly in the form of triples. All information in Wikidata (and similar knowledge databases) is stored in the form of triples; when you run the query, the query service tries to fill in the variables with actual values so that the resulting triples appear in the knowledge database, and returns one result for each combination of variables it finds.A triple can be viewed as two vertices (alias 2 nodes, 2 resources) connected by an edge (an arc, a property) inside the vast directed (oriented) property multigraph which forms Wikidata. It can be read like a sentence (which is why it ends with a period), with a subject, a predicate, and an object: SELECT ?fruit
WHERE
{
  ?fruit hasColor yellow.
  ?fruit tastes sour.
} The results for this query could include, for example, “lemon”. In Wikidata, most properties are “has”-kind properties, so the query might instead read: SELECT ?fruit
WHERE
{
  ?fruit color yellow.
  ?fruit taste sour.
} which reads like “?fruit has color ‘yellow’” (not “?fruit is the color of ‘yellow’” – keep this in mind for property pairs like “parent”/“child”!).However, that’s not a good example for WDQS. Taste is subjective, so Wikidata doesn’t have a property for it. Instead, let’s think about parent/child relationships, which are mostly unambiguous.

Just learning the SPARQL basics will get you a long way – even if you stop reading after #Our first query, you will already understand enough to construct many interesting queries. Each section of this tutorial will empower you to write even more powerful queries.If you have never heard of Wikidata, SPARQL, or WDQS before, here’s a short explanation of those terms: Wikidata is a knowledge database. It contains millions of statements, such as “the capital of Canada is Ottawa”, or “the Mona Lisa is painted in oil paint on poplar wood”, or “gold has a melting point of 1,064.18 degrees Celsius”. SPARQL is a language to formulate questions (queries) for knowledge databases. With the right database, a SPARQL query could answer questions like “what is the most popular tonality in music?” or “which character was portrayed by the most actors?” or “what’s the distribution of blood types?” or “which authors’ works entered the public domain this year?”. WDQS, the Wikidata Query Service, brings the two together: You enter a SPARQL query, it runs it against Wikidata’s dataset and shows you the result. SPARQL basics A simple SPARQL query looks like this: SELECT ?a ?b ?c
WHERE
{
  x y ?a.
  m n ?b.
  ?b f ?c.
} The SELECT clause lists variables that you want returned (variables start with a question mark), and the WHERE clause contains restrictions on them, mostly in the form of triples. All information in Wikidata (and similar knowledge databases) is stored in the form of triples; when you run the query, the query service tries to fill in the variables with actual values so that the resulting triples appear in the knowledge database, and returns one result for each combination of variables it finds.A triple can be viewed as two vertices (alias 2 nodes, 2 resources) connected by an edge (an arc, a property) inside the vast directed (oriented) property multigraph which forms Wikidata. It can be read like a sentence (which is why it ends with a period), with a subject, a predicate, and an object: SELECT ?fruit
WHERE
{
  ?fruit hasColor yellow.
  ?fruit tastes sour.
} The results for this query could include, for example, “lemon”. In Wikidata, most properties are “has”-kind properties, so the query might instead read: SELECT ?fruit
WHERE
{
  ?fruit color yellow.
  ?fruit taste sour.
} which reads like “?fruit has color ‘yellow’” (not “?fruit is the color of ‘yellow’” – keep this in mind for property pairs like “parent”/“child”!).However, that’s not a good example for WDQS. Taste is subjective, so Wikidata doesn’t have a property for it. Instead, let’s think about parent/child relationships, which are mostly unambiguous. Our first query Suppose we want to list all children of the baroque composer Johann Sebastian Bach. Using pseudo-elements like in the queries above, how would you write that query?Hopefully you got something like this: """@en;
