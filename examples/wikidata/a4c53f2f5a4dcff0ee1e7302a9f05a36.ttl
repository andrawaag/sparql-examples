 Try it!—MisterSynergy (talk) 19:41, 1 June 2017 (UTC)Tnx! Steak (talk) 06:57, 2 June 2017 (UTC) A couple of problems I have the following query. SELECT ?game ?gameLabel ?enwiki ?devLabel ?publisherLabel ?date WHERE {
	?game wdt:P31 wd:Q7889;
	wdt:P136 wd:Q744038.
    OPTIONAL {
      ?enwiki schema:about ?game;
      schema:isPartOf <https://en.wikipedia.org/>
    }
#    OPTIONAL {
      ?game wdt:P178 ?dev.
      ?game wdt:P123 ?publisher.
      ?game wdt:P577 ?date.
#    }
 	SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }
} ORDER BY ASC (?date)
 Try it! Two questions: I have commented out the second \"OPTIONAL\" clause because it was messing up the output of the query service. Without doing so, instead of several columns the output is all in a single cell, and the \"devLabel\", \"publisherLabel\" and \"date\" values are missing. But I do *not* want to skip rows with no date, developer or publisher. Can this be fixed? I exported as CSV and imported into Excel and converted the URL strings to hyperlinks. When I click on the hyperlinks in Excel, I am being sent to the wrong page. For instance, I am being sent to \"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/Q1255124.json\" instead of \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1255124\". Can this be fixed? Thanks very much. SharkD (talk) 23:29, 26 May 2017 (UTC) With your first problem, the fix is to break up that OPTIONAL clause into three separate OPTIONAL clauses. As it is, the clause will only return results if the game has a developer, a publisher, and a publication date. If it lacks any one of these, the clause as a whole will fail and none of the properties will appear. Why the results appear all in one column is simply to do with the formatting of the table output: when there are too many columns to fit on the screen, it presents results with the field names listed on the left rather than each field with its own column. This shouldn't affect how the results appear in CSV or TSV downloads. As for your second problem, I'm baffled. MartinPoulter (talk) 13:56, 30 May 2017 (UTC) Thanks! The second problem was resolved by searching and replacing text in the URL like this: BIND(CONCAT(\"=hyperlink(\\\"\",replace(replace(STR(?game), \"entity\", \"wiki\"), \"http\", \"https\"),\"\\\")\") AS ?dataLink). SharkD (talk) 03:35, 3 June 2017 (UTC) Sort ordering within a group I have this script: SELECT

 Try it! Currently I sort the entire result set by `?dateYears`. But, can I also sort the `?dateYear` (no \"s\") values within each group? Will this require subqueries? I learned that you can use `ORDER BY` within `group_concat` in Microsoft TSQL, but I don't know if you can do this in SPARQL as well. Thanks. SharkD (talk) 03:47, 3 June 2017 (UTC) I think this is still an open question: Wikidata_talk:SPARQL_query_service/queries/Archive/2016#GROUP_CONCAT_and_ORDER_BY. --- Jura 04:14, 3 June 2017 (UTC) Ah, yes. I was wondering why it only happened some times. Is there a workaround? SharkD (talk) 04:41, 3 June 2017 (UTC) Detect \"unknown value\" and \"no value\" I have some optional fields in my script to retrieve the year a video game was published. OPTIONAL {

        }
 Try it! However, this does not work when the value of the item is \"unknown\" or \"no value\". How do I catch these two cases? Thanks. SharkD (talk) 01:05, 2 June 2017 (UTC) ?item wdt:P577 ?value . FILTER (isBlank(?value)) ?item p:P577/a wdno:P577 @SharkD: both were used in Items with novalue claims and Items with unknown value claims at Property talk:P577. d1g (talk) 02:01, 2 June 2017 (UTC) @D1gggg:: I should have been more clear. I don't want to filter these items out. I just want different text to show up if the items are: 1) blank, 2) unknown or 3) no value. Sorry. SharkD (talk) 02:20, 2 June 2017 (UTC) @SharkD: you could use BIND/variables and IF to achieve any custom logic. d1g (talk) 02:32, 2 June 2017 (UTC) SELECT ?prefix ?type ?value ?customText

And the relevant bits: deleted I am not getting anything other than empty strings however. SharkD (talk) 15:32, 2 June 2017 (UTC) Here is a more minimal case.

 Try it! However, when I adapt it to my larger main script, the query times out. Is there any way I can run the query past the timeout time? Thanks! SharkD (talk) 19:16, 2 June 2017 (UTC) @SharkD: it may change output if you place required sections after latest optional tinyurl.com/y9wdzwda - 100 results in 32 s. d1g (talk) 02:24, 3 June 2017 (UTC) I actually posted the wrong link in my last message. But I instead decided to ignore \"unknown value\" since it cannot be distinguished from a blank value, and the script is not timing out any longer. SharkD (talk) 03:41, 3 June 2017 (UTC) @SharkD: I don't understand why your last-1 query isn't functional. When you add a wd:Q913503, it will output \"unknown value\" Which information do you need beyond that? d1g (talk) 06:11, 3 June 2017 (UTC) @D1gggg: I am not sure what you mean. But here is my current query, which times out due to the three lines marked \"too slow\". SharkD (talk) 02:10, 4 June 2017 (UTC) @SharkD:, almost the same comments, your query is fine except: line 62: replace ?boogie with specific prefix, not arbitrary (?item p:P577/a wdno:P577 or ?item p:P577/rdf:type wdno:P577). I used arbitrary prefix only to demonstrate how it works. line 62-65: should be before every OPTIONAL block tinyurl.com/y7n3aajn 1865 Results in 23806 ms d1g (talk) 03:23, 4 June 2017 (UTC) @D1gggg: The `?dateYears` column is now missing from all of the results. Can this be fixed? SharkD (talk) 04:21, 4 June 2017 (UTC) @SharkD: it was using YEAR(?date), I missed that during move (order is actually matters) If we place code back it will return them except first one (Q4034255). ?dateYear is empty because ?date is optional. any other questions left unanswered? d1g (talk) 05:17, 4 June 2017 (UTC) Place what code back, to where? I can't understand just from your words. SharkD (talk) 06:03, 4 June 2017 (UTC) tinyurl.com/ybgxyzls right after OPTIONAL {?game wdt:P577 ?date} d1g (talk) 06:17, 4 June 2017 (UTC) @D1gggg: Ah, okay. Thanks! However, now the items with a blank date are missing. I think there should be ~2000 results per my previous tests, with ~150 of them having blank dates. SharkD (talk) 07:28, 4 June 2017 (UTC) Arbitrary break @SharkD: I not able to relate why we cannot use isBlank or how to use them all at once. narrowed questions down to tinyurl.com/y95fe5fw d1g (talk) 09:40, 4 June 2017 (UTC) @SharkD: I forgot to use COALESCE.

The inverse would also be a useful query I think. Steak (talk) 08:39, 3 June 2017 (UTC) situation with disambiguation page items is messy there is Wikidata:WikiProject Disambiguation pages; dealing with disambiguation page items isn’t easy, thus the aforementioned point is not surprising string comparisons in the query service are inefficient, thus timeouts show up even when you query for small sets “Wikimedia disambiguation page” is also often used as en-desc; it is more appropriate than the version with p nevertheless, try SELECT ?item ?itemDescription {

 Try it! --McSearch (talk) 17:56, 5 June 2017 (UTC) That is pretty close to what I am looking for. This is filtering on the label, I would like to filter on the actual sitelink, wiki_sitelink in this case (but cannot get it to work). Ainali (talk) 20:45, 5 June 2017 (UTC) It does filter on sitelink, name of ?sitelink_label is confusing but it's what you are looking for. ?wiki_sitelink is URI. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 06:13, 6 June 2017 (UTC) I am actually really looking for the URI's that ends with a question mark, not the labels of items. I am sorry I was not clear enough in my original request. Ainali (talk) 14:47, 6 June 2017 (UTC) You said you wanted sitelinks that end with a question mark which the query does show. If you searched for URIs ending with a ?, you would get no results. Just don't get confused by label mentioned in the query. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 15:11, 6 June 2017 (UTC) Yes, obviously I was confused since I am looking for URIs. But if there are no URIs ending with a question mark, then my problem is solved, thanks!

 Try it!Is en:List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 2017 in good shape? It seems doable to import from there, but if others already work to import this table to Wikidata, I don’t want to interfere… —MisterSynergy (talk) 12:17, 9 June 2017 (UTC)NB \"Start time: 2017\" will pick up anyone elected in a byelection earlier in 2017 (were there any who were't re-elected? Can't recall.) Also worth noting that member of (P463):[parliament] as a primary property is now deprecated; we're slowly working on moving this across to be a parliamentary term (P2937) qualifier on position held (P39) - see Wikidata:WikiProject British Politicians.

However, the other one was requested as an alternative as well, but it is not that simple to exclude former MPs in that way. —MisterSynergy (talk) 12:41, 9 June 2017 (UTC) I was adding results most of last night, but as I was using it as a chance to migrate all the old records from member of (P463) to position held (P39)s with relevant parliamentary term (P2937)s, it was fairly slow going, so I only got the first 100 or so results declared. Unfortunately most of the tools for bulk import don't handle adding a new P39 without interfering with existing ones, so short of writing a custom bot, I don't know of a way to automate this. (FWIW I've also been adding elected in (P2715) = 2017 United Kingdom general election (Q25052149) to them all, along with electoral district (P768), member of political party (P102), and votes received (P1111) (the last one strictly doesn't belong here, but unless/until we have individual election items for each constituency, it seemed more useful to capture it whilst it was to hand, and migrate it later if needed) --Oravrattas (talk) 18:06, 9 June 2017 (UTC) An import/migration will happen, but at the moment doing it by hand is safest. The \"member of\" properties can't automatically be added to P39, as Oravrattas says, because a lot of people have multiple different P39s due to representing different seats. It's going to be a long grind! Andrew Gray (talk) 20:18, 9 June 2017 (UTC)@Pigsonthewing, Andrew Gray: I adapted the query to the model proposed by Andrew. Not all new MPs are already updated, but this lists of new MPs already populates:SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?itemDescription ?website ?twitter ?image ?startTime ?endTime ?party ?election ?electoralDistrict ?replaces ?replacedBy {
  ?item p:P39 ?positionStatement .
  ?positionStatement ps:P39 wd:Q16707842; pq:P2937 wd:Q29974940 .
  MINUS { ?item p:P39 [ ps:P39 wd:Q16707842; pq:P2937 [ ^(wdt:P155+) wd:Q29974940 ] ] . }
  MINUS { ?item wdt:P463 [ ^(wdt:P155+) wd:Q29974940 ] . }
  OPTIONAL { ?positionStatement pq:P580 ?startTime . }
  OPTIONAL { ?positionStatement pq:P582 ?endTime . }
  OPTIONAL { ?positionStatement pq:P768 ?electoralDistrict . }
  OPTIONAL { ?positionStatement pq:P102 ?party . }
  OPTIONAL { ?positionStatement pq:P2715 ?election . }
  OPTIONAL { ?positionStatement pq:1365 ?replaces . }
  OPTIONAL { ?positionStatement pq:1365 ?replacedBy . }
  OPTIONAL { ?item wdt:P18 ?image . }
  OPTIONAL { ?item wdt:P856 ?website . }
  OPTIONAL { ?item wdt:P2002 ?twitter . }
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language 'en' }
}
 Try it!So someone is importing obviously. If you’d like to see all MPs of the new parliament, comment the two MINUS sections by adding a # to the beginning of the line (the query also tries to exclude MPs from former parliaments which still only have claims from the deprecated model using P463). —MisterSynergy (talk) 13:52, 9 June 2017 (UTC)@Pigsonthewing, MisterSynergy, Oravrattas:. Okay. It looks like all of yesterday's new MPs have the new parliamentary term set, but very few existing ones do. I've fixed all the ones that still use P463. This query gets a report of everyone who has the P2937 qualifier on P39 set (155 at time of writing) SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?itemDescription {
  ?item p:P39 ?positionStatement .
  ?positionStatement ps:P39 wd:Q16707842; pq:P2937 wd:Q29974940 .
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language 'en' }
}
 Try it! and this petscan report shows all the ones still to do. I'll get to work updating them... Andrew Gray (talk) 20:39, 9 June 2017 (UTC) Find all uses of a certain property How would I do this? PokestarFan • Drink some tea and talk with me • Stalk my edits • I'm not shouting, I just like this font! 02:06, 10 June 2017 (UTC) Should be something like this (for X username (P2002) in this case, you can change this): SELECT ?item ?value ?snak {
  wd:P2002 wikibase:claim ?claim; wikibase:statementProperty ?statementProperty; wikibase:qualifier ?qualifier; wikibase:reference ?reference .
  {
    ?item ?claim [ ?statementProperty ?value ] .
    BIND('mainsnak' AS ?snak) .
  } UNION {
    ?item ?anyprop [ ?qualifier ?value ] .
    BIND('qualifier' AS ?snak) .
  } UNION {
    ?item ?anyprop [ prov:wasDerivedFrom [ ?reference ?value ] ] .
    BIND('reference' AS ?snak) .
  }
} ORDER BY ASC(?snak) ASC(?value)
 Try it! —MisterSynergy (talk) 06:27, 10 June 2017 (UTC) Alias = Label I would like to have a query which gives me all items that have, for a certain language, an alias which is the same like the label. Or is there already somewhere such a list? I assume this is not new observation that label = alias does frequently occur and should be corrected by removing the redundant alias. Steak (talk) 09:19, 10 June 2017 (UTC) The problem is that if alias=label, is necessary check if the label is correct, a lot of time sitelink are added in item where already exist label in the same lang, but the label isn't update. The query must return also the sitelink of the wikiprojects in the same language. --ValterVB (talk) 11:27, 10 June 2017 (UTC) I am not saying that this can be done by bot. But yes, the sitelink if existing should also be returned (which is not a problem I assume?). Steak (talk) 12:38, 10 June 2017 (UTC) Query by century Hi,I wanted to put layers on a map by century of inception (P571). I've got this : #defaultView:Map
SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?coord (round(YEAR(?date)/100) as ?layer)
WHERE
{
	?item wdt:P131+ wd:Q12549 ; wdt:P625 ?coord ; wdt:P571 ?date .
	SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"fr\" }
}
 Try it! Is there a better way to get the century of a date? In bonus: for visual understandability, is it possible to get a gradient of colours?Cdlt, VIGNERON (talk) 10:56, 11 June 2017 (UTC) Your way of getting century looks good, except that you should use CEIL() instead (ROUND(1650 / 100) = 16 but it's in the 17th century). Matěj Suchánek (talk) 11:27, 11 June 2017 (UTC) Concatenate more values I'm playing with discography and Wikidatalist. I have generated a page for the list of the album with link to the a user page page for the album. Now I have this query to have the tracklist (example for Per un amico (Q530546)); SELECT ?song ?songLabel ?composerLabel ?lyrics_byLabel WHERE {
    BIND(wd:Q530546 AS ?item) # this is the item of the album
    ?item wdt:P658 ?song.
    ?song wdt:P86 ?composer. # need concatenate all the composer
    ?song wdt:P676 ?lyrics_by # need concatenate all the lyrics by
   SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en,it\" .}
  }
 Try it! It's possible sort by qualifier series ordinal (P1545) that there is in tracklist (P658) It's possible concatenate all the value in composer (P86) and lyricist (P676) so we have only one row for song (ex. \"Flavio Premoli, Franco Mussida\")? We need one row because Wikidatalist show only one row if exist multiple row for the same item. --ValterVB (talk) 12:52, 11 June 2017 (UTC)  Items used: Per un amico (Q530546)   Properties used: tracklist (P658)   , composer (P86)   , lyricist (P676)   """@en;
