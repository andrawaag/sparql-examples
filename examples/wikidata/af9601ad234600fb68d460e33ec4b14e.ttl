I rushed over and created an existing page for the same link. Conde Edmond Dantès (talk) 00:40, 1 August 2019 (UTC) Elimination likely isn't the answer. It sounds to me like you created a dublicated item. In that case you have to merge both items that are about the same thing. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 11:12, 1 August 2019 (UTC) Discussing a potential merge I think the items comptroller (Q673633) and controller (Q12306661) should be merged. As far as I can tell, they are both about the occupation, called \"comptroller\" or \"controller\". Some of the links should arguably be in the item auditor (Q10949665) instead. The thing is, I'm not completely certain to what extent these concepts overlap in all of the different languages. Where should I bring this potential merge up for discussion? Gabbe (talk) 04:50, 1 August 2019 (UTC) No languages \"⧼valueview-expertextender-languageselector-languagetemplate⧽\" instead of languages for name (P2561) is showing in the list of languages. Eurohunter (talk) 16:16, 2 August 2019 (UTC) Hello, this could be related to Wikidata:Project_chat#Unit_box_not_appearing?. --M2k~dewiki (talk) 16:27, 2 August 2019 (UTC) Yup (not certain if actually related but we’re tracking it in the same task), I’m on it right now --Lucas Werkmeister (WMDE) (talk) 16:34, 2 August 2019 (UTC) Seems to be fixed now. --Lucas Werkmeister (WMDE) (talk) 17:55, 2 August 2019 (UTC)  Hi! I wonder how the value of ⧼valueview-expertextender-languageselector-languagetemplate⧽ can be queried in a multi-property query. Please see Yiddish list. Thanks for your feedback in advance!

I created Ragnheiður Steindórsdóttir (Q66057526) because of a misspelling on a related webpage but today trying to write an article I could find the already existing Ragnheiður Steindórsdóttir (Q16424080) which is already linked to iswiki. Please merge the items. Thanks in advance! I assume that Wikidata:Project chat ahouls have a high level selector \"Request merge\".

Premeditated (talk) 10:29, 7 August 2019 (UTC) import from WP infobox Is there a tool that imports infobox field entries from WP for existing WD items? People make updates in WP which don't get reflected here. --SCIdude (talk) 08:43, 5 August 2019 (UTC) I will recommend using harvesttemplates for an easy interface, and the pywikibot script harvest_template.py for more advance usage. DISCLAIMER: Be careful with what you import as the tool it not very smart and just include everything that has a WP-link. - Premeditated (talk) 08:52, 5 August 2019 (UTC)  I think that this discussion is resolved and can be archived. If you disagree, don't hesitate to replace this template with your comment. Premeditated (talk) 10:28, 7 August 2019 (UTC) edit check I'm wondering what I did wrong to trigger a revert - see this If I'm messing up - let me know now before I continue too much further. Reverts usually signal something really wrong. TY for your time Ched (talk) 15:31, 5 August 2019 (UTC) The field is called \"description\" so adding \"description\" in there isn't really helpful. Try to write a sentence \"<heat lightening> <is (a)> <text from description>\" BTW, English labels and descriptions should usually start with lowercase letters. No period at the end. Help:Description might help. \"lightning not accompanied by thunder sound\" might do. --- Jura 15:43, 5 August 2019 (UTC) good point on the word \"description\" - trying to remember lower case and no period - thanks for your time Ched (talk) 15:54, 5 August 2019 (UTC)  I think that this discussion is resolved and can be archived. If you disagree, don't hesitate to replace this template with your comment. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 09:59, 7 August 2019 (UTC) Petscan ? Tracked in Phabricator Task T229921 Resolved Hi, Petscan is down for me since yesterday. Am I alone ? I've try Firefox and Chrome, same thing. I've try to find a bug on Phabricator, but I see nothing. I though to enter an issue, but Magnus is away, so someone/somewhere else to contact ? Simon Villeneuve (talk) 10:53, 6 August 2019 (UTC) @Simon Villeneuve: PetScan is down for me as well. I've reported it to Phabricator (phab:T229921) since it might be something out of his control. Jc86035 (talk) 11:47, 6 August 2019 (UTC) This is likely related to a planned maintenance downtime of the server [1]. --Pasleim (talk) 15:53, 6 August 2019 (UTC) Magnus restarted Petscan this morning. — Envlh (talk) 06:47, 7 August 2019 (UTC)  I think that this discussion is resolved and can be archived.
