Vojtěch Dostál (talk) 07:47, 26 November 2021 (UTC) request to remove inverses with P1830 for paintings (2021-11-23) Request date: 23 November 2021, by: Jura1 Link to discussions justifying the request Wikidata_talk:WikiProject_sum_of_all_paintings#museum_etc._\"owner_of\"_painting_(inverse_of_\"owned_by\") Task description The statements with owner of (P1830) duplicate the information already added with owned by (P127) and can be removed. --- Jura 11:36, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Discussion  Request process request to replace qualifiers in GND ID (2021-06-07) Request date: 7 June 2021, by: Kolja21 Link to discussions justifying the request Help talk:P227 Task description Please replace in GND ID object named as (P1932) with subject named as (P1810) GND ID (P227) delete qualifier object named as (P1932) import name of object from GND with qualifier subject named as (P1810) add retrieved (P813) Scope: 5.161 qualifiers object named as (P1932), see Wikidata:Database reports/Constraint violations/P227#Properties statistics.Comment (in German): Man könnte hinzufügen, dass man über die OpenRefine Reconciliation oder über https://d-nb.info/gnd/100045642/about/lds.ttl (gndo:preferredNameForThePerson) recht einfach und schnell die aktuelle Version abfragen kann. (User:Emu) Example P1932 → P1810 Discussion Support The reason for this is the somewhat tricky difference between object named as (P1932) with subject named as (P1810) – see my illustration. --Emu (talk) 23:43, 7 June 2021 (UTC) Request process Accepted by (Ammarpad (talk) 14:01, 10 June 2021 (UTC)) and under process @Ammarpad Are you still working on this? Vojtěch Dostál (talk) 20:32, 25 November 2021 (UTC) request to cleanup DOI only items (2021-07-04) Request date: 4 July 2021, by: Jura1 Task description Items like Q57554778 consist mainly of DOI: the DOI is repeated as title and label. identify all such items. https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?search=10.1023&fulltext=1&ns0=1 finds some determine a datasource to complete them fix at least title and label ideally add author and published in (P1433) statements @Daniel Mietchen: who created some or all of them. @Trilotat: who mentioned some on Wikidata:Request_a_query#Items_with_DOI_(P356)_that_start_with_10.1023/A:_without_a_Label_or_a_title_(P1476). --- Jura 13:24, 4 July 2021 (UTC) @Jura1: To be precise, I was looking for items without a label, but I had seen this and did some research. A web search for any of the \"DOI as title\" DOIs will find that they are all or almost all noted in ResearchGate publication ID (P5875) items associated with Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata (Q15753202) journal. These items are published in (P1433) CrossRef Listing of Deleted DOIs (Q53952674). Q57554778 is 10.1023/A:1003902321787 and that DOI is mentioned in ResearchGate publication ID (P5875) 226608108. That researchgate item mentions the title and article details as Q107413498. I added the deleted DOI to that matched item as deprecated (as withdrawn identifier value). They should be merged, but I didn't as I thought it might confuse this bot request. In the future, I think we can add the new DOI to the bad items and then rerun SourceMD as I did with Q57030816, right? Trilotat (talk) 14:54, 4 July 2021 (UTC) List of items: User:Jura1/DOI as label. It was done using regexp 10\\..+/ for title (P1476) values. — Ivan A. Krestinin (talk) 20:15, 21 July 2021 (UTC) @Jura1 It seems that all the items listed in Ivan's query have defunct DOIs... Am I right? What would be the correct course of action there? Vojtěch Dostál (talk) 20:35, 25 November 2021 (UTC) Request process request to find references for novalue statements in \"spouse\" (P26) (2021-10-31) Request date: 31 October 2021, by: Jura1 Task description After creating new items for missing spouse (P26) at Wikidata:Database reports/top missing properties by number of sitelinks/P26, these tend to get additional statements and identifiers fairly frequently. This is less so for novalue statements. Sample: Q12325#P26 for James Buchanan (Q12325). Maybe there is a way to reference them with one or the other source. The proposed task is to find a suitable source and added references to such statements. --- Jura 12:57, 31 October 2021 (UTC) Discussion Apparently Wikitree has a flag \"no more marriages\" for this (according to User:Lesko987a), but it's generally not filled. I think that for readers this is visible by the absence of spouse unknown (even if the person has no spouse). --- Jura 12:03, 27 November 2021 (UTC) Request process (1) Query to find them: Items used: human (Q5)   , Latin Catholic priest (Q1469535)   Properties used: instance of (P31)   , date of death (P570)   , occupation (P106)   , spouse (P26)   , imported from Wikimedia project (P143)   "@en;
