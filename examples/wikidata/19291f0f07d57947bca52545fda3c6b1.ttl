Somehow I am to silly to query the statements of participating team (P1923) in this item. 92.75.209.157 18:03, 31 May 2019 (UTC) Try this query: SELECT ?item ?itemLabel {
  wd:Q704091 wdt:P1923 ?item .
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"de\". }
}
ORDER BY ?itemLabel
 Try it! --Larske (talk) 19:04, 31 May 2019 (UTC) Aaaah, by exchanging the wdt and wd arguments, did not try that^^. Now I would like to combine these results with this query that gives me all players that played in Bundesliga: SELECT ?item ?itemLabel {
  ?item wdt:P106 wd:Q937857 .
  ?item wdt:P118 wd:Q82595 .
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"de\". }
}
 Try it! So I would like to have only those Bundesliga players that have played for one of those clubs of the first query result. I think this query does the basic job: SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?club ?clubLabel ?itemLabel {
   wd:Q704091 wdt:P1923 ?club .

  ?item wdt:P106 wd:Q937857 .

 Try it! However, players that played for more than one team are listed twice, despite using \"SELECT DISTINCT\". How to get rid of the double entries? 92.75.209.157 20:25, 31 May 2019 (UTC) If you need the clubs, try using GROUP_CONCAT, like this: SELECT ?item (GROUP_CONCAT(?clublabel;SEPARATOR=', ') AS ?clubs) ?itemLabel {

In this activity, students will be invited to study the multinational composition of football teams. Because the project seeks to be ready before the upcoming UEFA European Championship in June 2020, we want to help the students by offering them a dataset which contains all basic information about all football players who took part in all UEFA European Championship (since 1960). The teacher will ask the students to build fictional football teams who would have participated in fictional football tournaments in the past (e.g. Ottoman Empire, Poland with different borders, etc.) as well as research how nationality and citizenship developed differently.We would be very happy if somebody could help us gather this data from WikiData, because: The teachers involved will have a lot more time to design the activity to be of high quality The students will be able to work with a very large data set, which means they can peer-learn about more contexts. The UEFA Tournament in 2020 will be able to highlight it's rich history of diversity THE REQUEST In order for the educational activity to work, we would need for all national teams who participated in the UEFA European Championships the following data: On the level of the Tournament: Host country Year On the level of the Team: Tournament in which it participated Country (at the time of the Tournament) On the level of the Players: Full Name Date of birth Place of birth Country of birth (at the time of birth) Playing position Clubs where they played On the level of the Clubs where the Players played: Name Place Country (at the time that the player played there) – The preceding unsigned comment was added by Evenzoharj (talk • contribs). @Evenzoharj: a vast part of the data seems to be missing, but even with incomplete data you can have some good results to start (and you have almost a year to improve the data ). Here are the query corresponding to your needs : Tournament level: SELECT ?tournament ?tournamentLabel ?hostCountryLabel (year(?date) AS ?year ) WHERE {
  ?tournament wdt:P3450 wd:Q260858 ; wdt:P17 ?hostCountry ; wdt:P585 ?date .

I manage to do have the list of items but I would like to have the value of the coordinate itself too (to then build more complex queryies, such as comparing with other coordinates on the same item, filtering by distance, etc. all sort of things I already know how to do).

My script loops through a large number of database records and for each builds a query like the below for \"Paris.\" This query is successful but takes 17-21 seconds! So I need some help to optimize it. I've tried various things; those that don't error out or produce no result end in timeouts. For example, I've moved the type (P31) constraint from a filter to the first line in WHERE, like e.g. ?place (wdt:P31/wdt:P279*) wd:Q486972; rdfs:label ?placeLabel . The speed is in the same range.I'm not a sparql newbie, but not expert and could use a hand figuring out if this will be viable.

I have the 3D graph, and I have a UI for populating it, but I was hoping to get some data to start with, and so I found wikidata.I was wondering if you could give me a query that returns json in the following form:``` { persons: [{
     id: some id,
     name: 'their full name',
     from: 'their date of birth',
     until: 'their date of death'
     links: [sources for this information],

     id: some id,

 Try it!--Tagishsimon (talk) 23:39, 6 June 2019 (UTC)@Tagishsimon: Yes. It would seem that the geof:distance function does no type checking, so removing all the geo:wktLiteral stuff, and just comparing two strings, it still returns the same result [2]. Whereas the map-view in the GUI does check on the type of a column, to decide whether it should be plotted on the map or not. It's interesting that nothing complains at \")\"^^geo:wktLiteral that \")\" isn't a valid form for a geo:wktLiteral, but from the standard it would appear that \"The query processor does not have to have any understanding of the values in the space of the datatype\" -- as far as the query processor need be concerned, a datatype is just an arbitrary tag associated with the literal.

 Try it! @Jura1: Got it. Here's a solution by batching them into chunks before comparing to the milestones. Change the batch size (currently 20000) to balance the tradeoff between runtime and resolution for even bigger sets. --99of9 (talk) 14:30, 11 June 2019 (UTC) For example this catches all items with *any* property=France (Q142), not just country (P17). --99of9 (talk) 14:40, 11 June 2019 (UTC) Clever! Thanks. I included the first query in the property documentation page. I think I will try to add this one too. It seems to work up to ca. 5 million items (sample: P932 ). --- Jura 14:52, 11 June 2019 (UTC) Niger(ia)/Dominica(n Republic)/(Democratic )Republic of the Congo/ .. When trying to determine countries from text, I usually avoid confusing the above. Even if everybody else gets them right, maybe it's worth to set up a few database reports/queries to check that places or people between these two countries don't get mixed-up. --- Jura 08:07, 10 June 2019 (UTC) Items linking to both One way could be to check items that link to both, e.g. Items used: Niger (Q1032)   , Nigeria (Q1033)   """@en;
