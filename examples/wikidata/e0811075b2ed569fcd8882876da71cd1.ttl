Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 16:23, 28 January 2020 (UTC) I am pretty sure that this cannot be queried with a simple tool.

In risk engineering, a very simplisitic way to estimate the frequency of accidents in tunnels could be to estimate the following ratio (for a given geographical zone) (kilometers of roads in tunnel) / (overall kilometers of roads).

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 19:28, 3 February 2020 (UTC) Hello @Tagishsimon: and thank you for your answer, but this is not what I am looking for. Both your suggestions are about finding the newest information, while my query is designed to work with historical data. I am not trying to find the current value, but the right one at the time I'm studying. When a commune changes its INSEE code after 2017, I still need to find it under the code it had in 2017. Conversely, when I use this query to get the list of communes in 1966, I expect Avernes (Q55589867) to show up with its INSEE code from that time. Regards, Arpyia (talk) 20:54, 3 February 2020 (UTC) Sorry about that. Probably something like the query below (though there are probably many ways of doing much the same). I do think that the current value for INSEE in Avernes (Q55589867) should be preferred rank; it is the current truthy value & that's why we have rank. So I'm sorry to see you have changed it back.

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 21:59, 3 February 2020 (UTC) Hello @Tagishsimon:, and thank you again for your research. This is going in the direction I was hoping for. There are still issues, because there should be a way to find more precise data, i.e. find information for each day instead of for the whole year. Anyway, this new query returns different and unexpected errors, so I need to investigate the data again. Regards, Arpyia (talk) 20:00, 4 February 2020 (UTC) It is easy to change the code to use day precision instead of year. The variables ?startdate and ?enddate isn't necessary and the date filters can be changed to: filter (!bound(?start) || ?start <= ?dateRecherche)
filter (!bound(?end) || ?end >= ?dateRecherche)
 Ideally you might want to also add a test for the precision of the date values. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 20:53, 4 February 2020 (UTC) Hello @Tagishsimon: and @Dipsacus fullonum:, I think this is working!

 Try it! Above is version 2. I moved the API access to a subquery and tried to get links to the articles. Currently the subquery gives 3 results, so I am surprised that getting ?article_en and ?article_it takes long time. With both outcommented as above, the whole query takes about 1 second. But if I try to get ?article_it, it takes 50 seconds. And If I try to get ?article_en, it times out. Can anyone explain, or even better fix, that? --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) I found the answer myself. It was (of course) that the engine tried to get all articles before running the subquery, and the solution is to change it to a named subquery which will run first. Version 3 is below.

Whether information obtained in this way is then (re)usable is left as a topic for discussion. But it's certainly a nice SPARQL demo exercise. Jheald (talk) 22:14, 6 February 2020 (UTC) Alternatively one could gather up the shapefiles (eg from [1]), and then see which nearby constituencies have boundaries that share common nodes. Jheald (talk) 22:19, 6 February 2020 (UTC) @Pigsonthewing: Maybe a bit \"off topic\", but the set of constituency of the House of Commons (Q27971968) seems to be in need for some care before any query related to geography could be really meaningful: A lot of suspected duplicates (said to be the same as (P460)) exist located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) is missing for a lot of objects coordinate location (P625) is missing for most objects geoshape (P3896) is missing for all objects shares border with (P47) is missing for all but ten objects (and maybe incomplete also for those ten) For details refer to this query: SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?located_inLabel ?coord ?geoshape (GROUP_CONCAT(?adjacent_to_label;SEPARATOR=', ') AS ?adjacents) ?said_to_be_same_as ?said_to_be_same_asLabel WHERE

Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 10:01, 7 February 2020 (UTC) I left the ball in Andrew's court - User talk:Andrew Gray#Constituency snafu? although I'm not sure at this distance what I was wittering on about. Looks complicated and HMMV. --Tagishsimon (talk) 10:10, 7 February 2020 (UTC) I've started documenting this at Wikidata:WikiProject British Politicians/Constituencies, and its talk page. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 10:15, 7 February 2020 (UTC) @Larske, Tagishsimon, Pigsonthewing: Yes, there's definitely a lot of work needing doing here, and I haven't had as much time to work on it as I'd hoped. The said to be the same as (P460) links are a bit of a problem - we don't have a clear property to describe what I want to say, which is \"these are meaningfully different things with the same name, which are often treated as all being the same thing\". We definitely want to keep them seperated, so please don't merge - at the moment there is one item for each distinct start/end, plus for substantial changes like a switch in the number of MPs. P131 and so on are all on my \"do in the fullness of time\" list, but there are some thorny problems yet to figure out - most of the UK admin areas have changed substantially over time so it's not always clear quite what parent areas we should use for P131. (eg all the modern constituencies are mapped into regions - do we want to keep this approach for historic constituencies that pre-date the official regions) Geoshapes are desirable but I have held off adding them due to concerns about copyright - my understanding was always that we need these to be CC-0 to go on Commons, though from a chat with @Jheald: recently it seems we might have found a workaround for this, in which case we can import. Finally, for \"adjacent\" - to be honest, this is something I'd never even thought of trying to model! Can't hurt to do it as suggested, though. Andrew Gray (talk) 10:46, 7 February 2020 (UTC) @Andrew Gray: Some comments: The use of said to be the same as (P460) is just an early signal that the item could/should be merged! If you have two (or more) different objects, Qn and Qm, that should be kept apart although they might have the same name and thus becomes mixed up, I think you should add the property different from (P1889) to both of them, i.e. Qn different from (P1889) Qm and Qm different from (P1889) Qn. That will tell others not to merge them. You may also want to change the instance of (P31), like from \"X\" to \"former X\", to make the differenct more obvious. If the located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) has varied over time, you can use several located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)-statements, each with a relevant start time (P580) and/or end time (P582) as qualifier. As at most one of the located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)-statements should lack a end time (P582) qualifier, the current value could be found by SPARQL filtering for that, i.e. ignore all statements with a end time (P582) qualifier. The same could be applied also for number of seats in assembly (P1410) and other properties that varies over time. --Larske (talk) 13:43, 7 February 2020 (UTC) \"an early signal that the item could/should be merged\" That's certainly not my understanding of its meaning, nor is it supported by the property's description (at least in English), or its creation proposal. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 20:17, 7 February 2020 (UTC) @Pigsonthewing: Sorry, I missed the disputed part that I now see is part of the English description. The property said to be the same as (P460) doesn't have a Swedish description, just the label. But even if it is not a \"signal for merging\", I still think it would be good if this property could be avoided in case the object should be considered as \"not the same\". That's why I suggested that different from (P1889) should be used instead. --Larske (talk) 01:11, 8 February 2020 (UTC) @Larske: Thanks - I'll get them all switched to \"different from\". I'm reluctant to use different P31s, though, as really this should be clear from the dates. Andrew Gray (talk) 23:16, 7 February 2020 (UTC) @Larske: Running a switch to \"different from\" now (should be done and through to the query service in a couple of hours). Thanks for the advice :-) Andrew Gray (talk) 17:06, 8 February 2020 (UTC) @Jheald, Larske, Tagishsimon, Pigsonthewing, Andrew Gray: Jheald suggested using a federated query to the Ordnance Survey SPARQL endpoint.

Andrew Gray (talk) 23:16, 7 February 2020 (UTC) @Dipsacus fullonum, Larske, Tagishsimon, Pigsonthewing, Andrew Gray: Just as a bit of fun, here's a plot of the adjacency network: tinyurl.com/tgpsob9 (Caveats: straight line may be the shortest distance between two points, but does not necessarily indicate where the constituencies touch; some constituencies may not have TOIDs; some constituencies may be questionably located; query may take some time to run (anything up to the full minute); terms and conditions apply; value of queries may go down as well as up...) Jheald (talk) 23:49, 7 February 2020 (UTC) St Ives; Arundel; and Worthing West, amongst others, may need another look. Jheald (talk) 23:57, 7 February 2020 (UTC) It is possible with SPARQL to the query Ordnance Survey for their data of constituencies (at least name, located in the administrative territorial entity (P131), coordinate location (P625), shares border with (P47)), compare with Wikidata data and write lists of deviations. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 01:48, 8 February 2020 (UTC) By using #defaultView:Graph in the federated query above you can see the adjacencies graphically also for those that lack coordinate location (P625) statement. It is a bit messy with all UK constiuencies, but if you limit the set of objects by filtering on located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) it looks quite nice: Here is an example with the set limited to objects with located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) equal to Wales (Q25). I don't know if it is possible to give a \"hint\" to the graph rendering on which node to place top(north)most and which node to place right(east)most. Now I guess it is just luck if the graph places the nodes in the correct \"geographical order\" from a north-south and west-east point of view. --Larske (talk) 11:48, 8 February 2020 (UTC) I had a look at St Ives & iirc Arundel; reluctant to say that I didn't see any issues, though not much wanting to get more drawn into this, nor to be told exactly how wrong I was.

Is it possible to find all instances of a class that have (language#1_label AND language#2_label) plus, if available, language#1_aliases OR language#2_aliases; listing them in four different columns?Exempli gratia: class \"written work\" (Q47461344), language#1 = English, language#2 = Italian book bookLabel (English) bookAltLabel (English) bookLabel (Italian) bookAltLabel (Italian) wd:Q62879 Christmas Carol [A Christmas Carol in Prose, ... ] Canto di Natale [Il canto di Natale , Cantico di Natale, ...] Thanks in advance DellaCG (talk) 20:44, 12 February 2020 (UTC) @DellaCG: This sort of thing; it's only looking at the class, not the subclasses - too many items. SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?en_label ?it_label (group_concat(?en_a; separator=\"; \") as ?en_alias) (group_concat(?it_a; separator=\"; \") as ?it_alias)

 Try it! If you prefer a bar chart, change LineChart to BarChart on the first line of the query. --Larske (talk) 07:10, 13 February 2020 (UTC) @Larske: Perfect!

Tennii (talk) Problems with FILTER unequal With the following query, i get 309 articles from the magazine \"Die Gartenlaube\" which have follows (P155). SELECT ?Die_Gartenlaube ?Die_GartenlaubeLabel ?follows ?followsLabel ?teilvon ?teilvonFollows  WHERE { 
  ?Die_Gartenlaube wdt:P1433 wd:Q655617;
    wdt:P155 ?follows.
  OPTIONAL { ?Die_Gartenlaube wdt:P179 ?teilvon. }
  OPTIONAL { ?follows wdt:P179 ?teilvonFollows. }
  #FILTER(?teilvon = ?teilvonFollows)
SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }
}
 Try it! But only 29 of them are correct, because they share the same articles series. SELECT ?Die_Gartenlaube ?Die_GartenlaubeLabel ?follows ?followsLabel ?teilvon ?teilvonFollows  WHERE { 
  ?Die_Gartenlaube wdt:P1433 wd:Q655617;
    wdt:P155 ?follows.

  OPTIONAL { ?follows wdt:P179 ?teilvonFollows. }
  FILTER(?teilvon = ?teilvonFollows)
SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }
}
 Try it!If i want to receive the 280 articles where ?teilvon is not equal with ?teilvonFollow i change the filter operator as follows:FILTER(?teilvon != ?teilvonFollows)but then i receive no results:SELECT ?Die_Gartenlaube ?Die_GartenlaubeLabel ?follows ?followsLabel ?teilvon ?teilvonFollows  WHERE { 
  ?Die_Gartenlaube wdt:P1433 wd:Q655617;

}
 Try it! What i am doing wrong here? Is there a problem filtering on optional values? --Mfchris84 (talk) 13:05, 13 February 2020 (UTC) Not sure what exactly you are trying, but to get empty (unbound) values as well, you need to use FILTER( ?teilvon != ?teilvonFollows || !BOUND(?teilvon) || !BOUND(?teilvonFollows) ) Another way could be to use something like FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?Die_Gartenlaube wdt:P179 ?teilvon. ?follows wdt:P179 ?teilvon. } --- Jura 13:25, 13 February 2020 (UTC) Thanks @Jura1:, :FILTER( ?teilvon != ?teilvonFollows || !BOUND(?teilvon) || !BOUND(?teilvonFollows) ) solved my problem. i want to receive the articles which are linked with the follows-property and which are not part of the same article series or even not part of any series (so they are more like a cited work). to filter all those articles which are part of the series was not a problem, but all the empty unbound values were the problem.
