  rdfs:comment """Wikidata pays a lot of tribute to authority control, linking to all kinds of datasets and databases with various IDs. The holy grail of every GLAM worker Sum of All People, with links to their Works is coming about!But we’re just at the start of a lot of work in that direction. The purpose of this project is to try and coordinate such work.I know a few things (ViafBot, Mix-n-Match) and I'd like to help with some things, but I don't know what others are doing. --Vladimir Alexiev (talk) 08:08, 27 January 2015 (UTC)[reply] Contents 1 Data Sources 1.1 RKDArtists Coreferencing 1.2 British Museum Coreferencing 1.3 ULAN Coref Relations 1.4 Match Persons not Disambiguation Pages 1.5 Coreference AAT 1.5.1 Coreference AAT with Mix-n-Match 1.5.2 Coreference AAT through BabelNet 1.5.2.1 AAT-Wordnet coref 1.5.2.2 AAT-Wordnet Overlaps 1.5.2.3 AAT-Wordnet2 Representation 1.5.2.4 AATNED-Cornetto Mapping 1.5.2.5 DBpedia-Wordnet3 coref 1.5.2.6 Wordnet3-Wordnet2 coref 1.5.2.7 AAT-Wikidata Sheets 1.5.3 AAT-LCSH coreferencing 2 Geonames Feature Code 3 Supplement Wikidata items with properties from authorities (GND in particular) 4 Property proposal for applying SKOS mapping relations to \"external identifiers\" 5 Grant proposal soweego 6 Remove Obsolete Getty Vocabularies IDs 7 VIAF Games 7.1 VIAF volumetrics 7.2 Wikidata to VIAF Coreferencing 7.3 VIAF Source Codes 7.4 VIAF Links per Source 7.5 VIAF Help Needed 7.6 Resolve Against VIAF Links 7.6.1 New VIAF Situation 7.7 From Wikipedia to Wikidata Link 7.8 ID Proliferation with VIAF 7.9 VIAF members 8 Swedish National Library moves direction Linked data 9 Introducing mapping relation type (P4390) for full SKOS mappings 9.1 Workflow for the mapping process 9.2 Quality control for mappings using mapping relation types 9.3 Feedback welcome 10 Item creation from a thesaurus concept via Quickstatements 11 History Data Sources [edit] The report Name Data Sources for Semantic Enrichment shows that when it comes to name data sources, maybe the two that matter are VIAF and Wikidata. Their name coverage is fairly orthogonal: VIAF has more name variations and permutations, Wikidata has more translations (Venn diagram of names for Cranach). VIAF is much bigger: 35M persons/orgs. Wikidata has 2.7M persons and maybe 1M orgs. Only 0.5M of Wikidata persons/orgs are coreferenced to VIAF, with maybe another 0.5M coreferenced to other datasets, either VIAF-constituent (eg GND) or non-constituent (eg RKDartists). So coreferenced part between the two is still quite small (30%) and a lot of work remains! A lot can be gained by leveraging coreferencing across VIAF and Wikidata: finding errors in Authority files, finding merge candidates in Wikidata, promulgating identifiers... Wikidata has great tools for crowd-sourced coreferencing. Please comment! RKDArtists Coreferencing [edit] RKDartists is an important Authority that does not yet participate in VIAF. There are already 21760 RKDartist id's on Wikidata. These could be imported to VIAF for free! British Museum Coreferencing [edit] The BM has several thesauri that are not co-referenced to anything in the world. I think they'd see it as a major win if the community helps them to co-reference. British Museum person or institution ID (P1711): 176461 persons, 21511 matched Wikidata:Property_proposal/British_Museum_place: 45883 places Wikidata:Property_proposal/British_Museum_thesauri: 28 more thesauri with 26804 entries This could be followed by importing the 2.5M cultural objects of the BM. ULAN Coref Relations [edit] ULAN does record possible matches and mismatches in their editorial system: ULAN Artists Whose Identity May be Associated or Confused With Another (608 pairs).Looks like this: x x_name x_bio rel y y_name y_bio ulan:500071106 Master of 1515 Portuguese painter, active 1515 gvp:ulan1005_possibly_identified_with ulan:500025279 Afonso, Jorge Portuguese painter and court artist, born ca. 1470-1475, died before 1540 ulan:500042027 Master of the Madre de Deus Retablo Portuguese painter, active 16th century gvp:ulan1005_possibly_identified_with ulan:500025279 Afonso, Jorge Portuguese painter and court artist, born ca. 1470-1475, died before 1540 ulan:500032055 Monogrammist A. M. Spanish artist, active 19th century gvp:ulan1005_possibly_identified_with ulan:500038287 Aguirre, Marcial Spanish sculptor, 1841-1900 Here's to proper coreferencing! --Vladimir Alexiev (talk) 18:07, 12 March 2015 (UTC)[reply] Match Persons not Disambiguation Pages [edit] We should match persons to persons, not disambiguation pages to persons or other disambiguation pages.Wikipedias, GND and RKD all have disambiguation pages (in GND they are called \"undifferentiated names\"). 13 Feb 2015: Wrote to Jane Wrote to Magnus: Filter out Disambiguation entries and Un-notable Persons Do you agree with my reasoning: Jane said \"any match is better than none\" I countered \"A correct match is better than none\" the only way to make sure it's correct is to examine more data about the person, which will necessarily lead you to a real person page. Look at the ULAN data above: that's good data that gives you some basis for decision. A name alone does not. --Vladimir Alexiev (talk) 19:34, 12 March 2015 (UTC)[reply] Support @Vladimir Alexiev, Randykitty, Ghuron: A GND Tn (Thesaurus name = undifferentiated) is not a stable disambiguation page. A Tn is a placeholder. It can be deleted, it can be upgraded into a Tp (Thesaurus person), or changed into a redirect. Works connected with a Tn will be checked by the library or archive who owns them and afterwards might be delinked. The database Online GND (OGND) includes only Tp numbers. --Kolja21 (talk) 00:04, 28 March 2015 (UTC)[reply] Coreference AAT [edit] AAT is a crucial thesaurus in cultural heritage. It has 40k concepts, see http://vocab.getty.edu/sparql select (count(*) as ?c) {
      ?x a skos:Concept; skos:inScheme aat: } Of them only 363 AAT are coreferenced, or under 1%, see http://tools.wmflabs.org/autolist/autolist1.html?q=CLAIM%5B1014%5D I think that's BAD. I'm sure going to need that coref for the Europeana Food and Drink Classification Scheme that will be based on Wikidata and AAT: presentation report Update: the AAT-Wordnet coreference described below is brought into Wikidata. AAT is actively coreferenced on Mix-n-Match: 12985 (32%) matched, 3293 (8%) awaiting confirmation, 1553 (3.8%) confirmed no-matches, and 22543 (55.7%) awaiting matching. So it's way better than 2 years ago. Help coreference this pivot thesaurus that is of immense importance for Cultural Heritage! --Vladimir Alexiev (talk) 15:04, 19 September 2017 (UTC)[reply] Coreference AAT with Mix-n-Match [edit] The Wikidata coref tool Mix-n-Match has mostly been used for people until now. But I hope it can be used for concepts as well.I made an export that includes AAT URL, preferred English label (without qualifier), parents (ascendants to root) and scope note (description). Could also add alternative labels, and labels in other languages (Dutch, Spanish, Chinese). select ?id (str(?lab) as ?label) ?parents (str(?scopeNote) as ?note) {
  ?x a gvp:Concept; dc:identifier ?id; gvp:prefLabelGVP/gvp:term ?lab;
     gvp:parentString ?parents.
  optional {?x skos:scopeNote [dct:language gvp_lang:en; rdf:value ?scopeNote]}
} I saved as XML then converted to TDV: aat.rar. rset --results tsv aat.xml > aat.tdv Also see https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mix%27n%27match#Coreference_AAT !!! Coreference AAT through BabelNet [edit] Mix-n-Match has good automatic matching, but that works for people.So let's check what other vocabs that are coref to AAT may be coref to Wikidata: According to Michiel Hildebrand's famous CH LOD diagram: CH LOD, cultural heritage linked open data (thesauri only) Wordnet. No such prop in Wikidata I'd guess Wiktionary is coref to Wordnet, but Wikidata got no site links to Wiktionary RKD Concepts. There's prop \"RKDartists\" and \"RKDimages\" but none for concepts Rijksmuseum Concepts. There's \"Rijksmonument\" but none for concepts Joconde: aha! There's Joconde work ID (P347), and it has 2275 instances, so that's better. Joconde is 18% coref to Wikidata but I don't know how much to AAT, maybe I can gain 1k here. Looked at the results: nope, Joconde are all paintings, not concepts Bibliopolis: never heard of it, and nope SVCN: never heard of it, and nope Then it dawns on me. BabelNet corefs Wordnet and Wikipedia! In fact, it corefs to Wikidata, see http://babelnet.org/stats. (Very useful stat: http://babelnet.org/stats#Numberofpolysemousandmonosemouswords) Some months ago they didn't have RDF access. But they do now: http://babelnet.org/download (not download, but API: good enough) On the web view of chipotle in Sources I see Wikidata On the RDF view http://babelnet.org/rdf/page/s00018522n I don't see Wikidata but I see DBpedia, so that's ok AAT-Wordnet coref [edit] Ok, so off to look for that AAT-Wordnet coref. - Why yes, it's part of http://semanticweb.cs.vu.nl/europeana/skos/browse/ - I got a file from somewhere that says <aat_wordnet20_mappings>
  a void:Linkset;

4581 The following AAT concepts have 2 matches: aat:bleachers
aat:boxcars
aat:cleavers
aat:feudalism
aat:groats
aat:jackstraws
aat:lats
aat:leotards
aat:morocco
aat:ninepins
aat:quoits
aat:shekels
aat:stairs We need to reconcile them manually, eg aat:bleachers  skos:closeMatch  <http://www.w3.org/2006/03/wn/wn20/instances/synset-bleacher-noun-1> .
aat:bleachers  skos:closeMatch  <http://www.w3.org/2006/03/wn/wn20/instances/synset-bleachers-noun-1> . The AAT definition is: aat:bleachers vp:descriptiveNote \"Use for benchlike tiered seating for spectators at, for example, outdoor sporting events, usually without weather or sun protection, affording less advantageous views than grandstands; may also be used for similarly constructed, often telescoping, indoor seating.\"@en . Inspection at Wordnet 3.1 shows that the second one is right. That's 4.6k matches, or 11% of AAT. AAT-Wordnet2 Representation [edit] The coref looks like this: aat:wrought_iron skos:closeMatch <http://www.w3.org/2006/03/wn/wn20/instances/synset-wrought_iron-noun-1> . And there's another file aat.ttl with rep like: aat:wrought_iron aat:parentPreferred aat:iron_alloy .
aat:wrought_iron vp:id \"300011012\" .
aat:wrought_iron vp:labelPreferred \"wrought iron\"@en .
aat:wrought_iron vp:labelNonPreferred \"iron, wrought\"@en .
aat:wrought_iron vp:labelNonPreferred \"wrought-iron\"@en . This is quite old rep. The new rep uses numeric URL: http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300011012 (and a bunch more data). So we need to construct a numeric URL. AATNED-Cornetto Mapping [edit] Cornetto is NL Wordnet and AATNED is NL AAT. I got another file saying: <aatned_cornetto_mappings>
  a void:Linkset ;
    dcterms:title \"AATNED-Cornetto mappings by Anna Tordai (baseline)\";
    lib:source <http://semanticweb.cs.vu.nl/lod/rkd/aatned/> ;
    void:dataDump <bl_aatned_cn.rdf.gz> , <bl_norm_aatned_cn.rdf.gz> , <bl_sing_aatned_cn.rdf.gz> . Eg we have this for AAT 300191645 \"salinity\": bl_aatned_cn.ttl: aatned:zoutheid  skos:closeMatch  cornetto:synset-zoutheid-1-noun .
cornetto-wn20.ttl: cornetto:synset-zoutheid-1-noun cornetto:eqNearSynonym instances:synset-brininess-noun-1 .
cornetto-wn30.ttl: cornetto:synset-zoutheid-1-noun cornetto:eqNearSynonym wn30:synset-brininess-noun-1 .
aatned.ttl: aatned:zoutheid core:notation \"300191645\" . The number of AATNED-Cornetto matches is as follows: > cat bl*|sort|uniq> bl_aatned_all.ttl
> wc -l bl_aatned_all.ttl
6917 bl_aatned_all.ttl
> cat bl_aatned_all.ttl|cut -d \" \" -f 1 | sort| uniq | wc -l
6857 There are more matches than AAT-Wordnet. There are also overlaps: 60 AATNED concepts (0.9%) have two Cornetto matches.We need to merge AATNED-Cornetto with AAT-Wordnet. The correlation is simply by id, eg aatned.ttl: aatned:zwerfkeien core:notation \"300011671\"
aat.ttl: aat:boulder vp:id \"300011671\" I guess the overlaps between them are quite big, eg for wrought_iron: aatned.ttl: aatned:smeedijzer core:notation \"300011012\"
bl_aatned_all.ttl: aatned:smeedijzer  skos:closeMatch  cornetto:synset-smeedijzer-1-noun .
cornetto-wn20.ttl:cornetto:synset-smeedijzer-1-noun cornetto:eqNearSynonym instances:synset-wrought_iron-noun-1 .
cornetto-wn30.ttl:cornetto:synset-smeedijzer-1-noun cornetto:eqNearSynonym wn30:synset-wrought_iron-noun-1 . DBpedia-Wordnet3 coref [edit] The other problem is bigger: http://www.w3.org/2006/03/wn/wn20/instances/synset-wrought_iron-noun-1 is Wordnet 2.0 in 9-year old rep, with wn20schema:synsetId \"113958999\" while BabelNet: http://babelnet.org/rdf/s00081730n has bn:s00081730n skos:exactMatch dbpedia:Wrought_iron, lemon-WordNet:wn30-14802262-n that uses a modern LEMON wordnet rep: http://lemon-model.net/lexica/pwn/wn30-14802262-n Note: Wordnet 3.1 has IDs like \"14826432\" and \"wrought_iron%1:27:00::\" It doesn't look like Wordnet3 and Wordnet2 share any IDs; we'll deal with that in next section.Lets first do some queries at http://babelnet.org/sparql/ to see what we can see. Look for DBpedia-Wordnet matches: SELECT * WHERE {
  ?x skos:exactMatch ?y, ?z 
  filter(strstarts(str(?y),\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/\"))
  filter(strstarts(str(?z),\"http://lemon-model.net/lexica/pwn/\"))
} LIMIT 30 Download: https://www.dropbox.com/s/92gq5r1qm3yytkp/WN3toDBP.csv?dl=1.It has 47607 rows like this (there's a decent chance this will cover the 6k AAT matches): \"http://babelnet.org/rdf/s00075206n\",\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sundowner_(drink)\",\"http://lemon-model.net/lexica/pwn/wn30-07913081-n\"

     31 schema http://schema.org/ Can we use them somehow to push this coreferencing further? I'm a little wary about importing these wholescale, because geonames in not a CC0 database. It's one thing to be providing external links to GeoNames, it's another to be importing data. I did look at these values recently for English places with geonames links that are marked as both village (Q532) and civil parish (Q1115575) (see eg Abberton (Q3137539) for an example), to identify which Geonames link corresponded to which role; but I purposely decided not to add a GeoNames feature code (P2452) statement. It might be useful to be able to map the codes to Q-numbers here, to facilitate sanity checking of exisiting or proposed co-references. However, even then there are difficulties -- for example, I found that PPLA3 or PPLA4 at Geonames didn't necessarily match to distinctions we would want to make in a instance of (P31) here.
