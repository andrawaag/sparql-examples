As I have to test the name for certain spelling mistakes or dialects with the levenshtein-distance, I need a list of all human settlements from wikidata with a certain amount of data (name (german), alternate name(german), coodinates, ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of state were the settlement is located and the types of settlement (town, vilage, capital, and so on) I have trouble solve the task. As I understand, the query will need a lot of time, so I set up a local wikidata but I still do not get the information, as I need it. The problem is, that there can be more than one type associetaed to one settlement. so I have to group my output in order to prevent duplicate results.Here is my query so far: SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?altname ?coord ?staat ?kurz (group_concat(?art) as ?arten)

Arlo Barnes (talk) 04:07, 5 July 2020 (UTC) How to filter out the minimum value of an expression X and get more columns than that particular expression besides the column(s) for the GROUP BY by expression(s)? I have this result: ?item ?expression_X ?expression_Y item1 2 y1 item1 1 y2 item1 3 y3 item2 11 y4 item2 22 y5 item3 7 y6 item3 5 y7 With a query like SELECT ?item (MIN(?expression_X) AS ?min_X)
GROUP BY ?item I will get this. ?item ?min_X item1 1 item2 11 item3 5 i.e. just keep the one row per item with the minimum value on expression_X for the respective item.My question is: What type of query/subquery should I use to get the following result? ?item ?min_X ?expression_Y item1 1 y2 item2 11 y4 item3 5 y7 i.e. with the column for ?expression_Y kept? --Larske (talk) 12:09, 31 January 2018 (UTC) Don't have time to write you an example query, but I think the stategy is a query with three parts - first, turn the full existing query into a named sub-query, then set ?min_X to the minimum value of X in the results of the sub-query, than set ?Y to the value of Y that corresponds to ?min_X in the sub-query results. Jheald (talk) 15:01, 31 January 2018 (UTC) Interesting question. If I understand this correctly : https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#aggregateRestrictions then an approach like SELECT ?item (MIN(?expression_X) AS ?min_X) ?expression_Y
GROUP BY ?item ( … as ?expression_Y)
 – The preceding unsigned comment was added by TomT0m (talk • contribs) at 16:22, 31 January 2018‎ (UTC). (ec) I'll come back to the sub-query approach in a moment. Before that, here's a more basic approach, taking advantage of User:Andrew Gray's outstanding work on the history of the House of Commons in the UK to find the \"Baby of the House\" (ie the youngest MP) in each parliament. The approach is to have an inner query that finds the latest date of birth in each parliament, then an outer query that finds which MP in that parliament had that date of birth. SELECT ?parlLabel ?parl_start ?item ?itemLabel ?dob WHERE {
  {
    SELECT ?parl (MAX(?dob) AS ?dob) WHERE {
        ?item wdt:P39 ?parl .
        ?parl wdt:P279 wd:Q16707842 .
        ?item wdt:P569 ?dob .
    } GROUP BY ?parl 
  }
  ?item wdt:P39 ?parl .
  ?item wdt:P569 ?dob .
  ?parl wdt:P571 ?parl_start .
      
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }
} ORDER BY ?parl_start
 Try it! The query reveals a couple of anomalies in the earliest parliaments that Andrew is just getting to the clean-up stage for -- Thomas Williams (Q7793765) who was apparently elected at the age of twelve, and John Aldridge (Q26250395) elected at the age of minus three! (Pedantic footnote: the query doesn't check that the MP served for the whole parliament -- for example, like David Steel (Q333847) they may have been elected at a bye-election; in which case there might have been a different MP, not listed here, who had been baby of the House up until that point). Jheald (talk) 16:26, 31 January 2018 (UTC) I had a pattern for the subquery that seem to match yours : select ?item ?min_X ?y {

  { SELECT ?item (MIN(?expression_X) AS ?min_X) GROUP BY ?item. }
  
  [ triple pattern or subquery compute ?x and ?y from ?item using expressionX and expressionY ]
  
  filter ( ?x = ?min_X) .
}
 author TomT0m / talk page 16:37, 31 January 2018 (UTC) Let me get back to you on that. Meanwhile, here is basically the same query as before, but this time using a named subquery: SELECT ?parlLabel ?parl_start ?item ?itemLabel ?dob 
  WITH {
    SELECT ?item ?parl ?dob WHERE {
        ?item wdt:P39 ?parl .
        ?parl wdt:P279 wd:Q16707842 .
        ?item wdt:P569 ?dob .
    }
  } AS %sub_query_results

WHERE {
  {
    SELECT ?parl (MAX(?dob) AS ?dob) WHERE {
      INCLUDE %sub_query_results .
    } GROUP BY ?parl
  }
  INCLUDE %sub_query_results .
  ?parl wdt:P571 ?parl_start .
      
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }
} ORDER BY ?parl_start
 Try it! This runs slightly more efficiently, because it only looks up the dates of births for the MPs in each parliament once, rather than twice as in the original query. The solution set from this is stored in the variable %sub_query_results One can then INCLUDE it, as a solution set, in the main query. Above, we do this twice: first in the inner query, which finds the latest DoB for each parliament in that solution set. Then in the outer query, we match the parliament and the DoB from the inner query to the rows in the INCLUDED solution set -- this is just SPARQL joining the results from different solution sets in the usual way, by stating the relevant requirements one after the other. The result is a query that completes a bit faster -- and also is easy for the engine to optimise, because we have explicitly told it (with the sub-query) what part of the query to run first. Note, btw, that %sub_query_results is just a variable name -- we could have called it anything. Jheald (talk) 16:51, 31 January 2018 (UTC) Thanks Jheald for your assistance! The named subquery did the trick. I just had to refrain from changing the variable name in \"(MIN(?x) AS ?x)\" in order for the JOIN to work as expected. Btw, if you look for the oldest members in the different parliaments, you will find other anomalies, like Sir Charles Burrell, 3rd Baronet (Q7526182) who probably wasn's very talkative in the three parliaments he was member of three to twelve years after his death. --Larske (talk) 20:16, 31 January 2018 (UTC) Love it! Paging @Andrew Gray: :-) Srsly, Andrew's done/doing a brilliant job of cleaning this dataset up -- you can really see the cut-off of where he's got to so far, going back in time, and more recently than that the anomalies are very very few (if any?) Serious respect is deserved. Jheald (talk) 20:27, 31 January 2018 (UTC) @Larske, Jheald: thanks both for these queries - they're really interesting to look at! At the moment I'm importing data from the Historic Hansard database, and we know that has some... interesting issues for less prominent people. I'm going through in parallel checking records against more reliable sources where they seem inconsistent, but hadn't done a run on birth and death dates yet. People being listed as MPs after their death was a surprise! I'll dig into these a bit more and get them corrected - thanks again for spotting them. Andrew Gray (talk) 20:40, 31 January 2018 (UTC) @Andrew Gray: William Kirk (Q8014050) is another one who was a member of two parliaments after his death. --Larske (talk) 12:10, 1 February 2018 (UTC) Show only first image I have a query that works nicely: #defaultView:Map
SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?itemDescription ?locationLabel ?coord (SAMPLE(?img) AS ?img) WHERE {
        ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q1965390 .
        ?item wdt:P276 ?location .
        ?location wdt:P625 ?coord .

        SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"de,de\". }
    }
GROUP BY ?item ?itemLabel ?itemDescription ?locationLabel ?coord
 Try it! Now some of the items have multiple images (e. g. look at the one dot that there is in \"Stuttgart\" right now), but I want only one to show, that's why there is the \"SAMPLE\" function. Is it possible to replace the SAMPLE part with something that shows me not any random, but only the first of the images in an item as in the sequence shown in the Wikidata user interface? How are multiple items in a property ranked anyway in a SPARQL query? Will the SAMPLE query always randomly chose, or will it at least chose between images of preferred rank? I can't find anything about that.What would be even better for my purpose would be a way to show a little gallery of all (or, say, the first 10) images in the item within that blurb that pops up on the map created by SPARQL (without creating multiple dots). Probably a feature request rather than a query request, but if it's already possible, I'd like to know it, too. Thanks in advance --Anvilaquarius (talk) 14:33, 2 February 2018 (UTC) If there are any images for an item that have preferred rank, then wdt:P18 will only see those, and won't see any of the others at all. In general this technique should only be used with caution, because you would also be hiding those images (or, more generally, values) from anybody else writing a query who only looked with wdt: The function MIN() can be used as a deterministic replacement for SAMPLE() -- here I presume it would return the first filename in alphabetic sequence, which may not be what you are looking for. If you want to select a particular image for each item, another approach might be to add a object of statement has role (P3831) qualifier to distinguish between the nature of the presented images. A sequence of OPTIONAL { } clauses would let you look for particular values in a preferential order. Jheald (talk) 14:53, 2 February 2018 (UTC) Thanks for the info. I feared so much... I didn't know about the \"preferred\" problems so I won't use this idea. --Anvilaquarius (talk) 16:54, 2 February 2018 (UTC) wd:Q468455 (death by burning) or wd:Q337935 (necromancy) Hi, I should want all women whom death by burning or by necromancy.

Why ? --Touam (talk) 19:47, 3 February 2018 (UTC) @Touam: Pretty-much nothing links to necromancy (Q337935) - see https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Q337935 ... so that element of the query will return little. Then, looking at the construction of the P509 / Q468455 clause, there does not seem to be a cause of death which is itself an instance of death by burning. Simpler by far to look for: SELECT ?iteme ?itemeLabel
WHERE {
    ?iteme wdt:P509 wd:Q468455;
            wdt:P21 wd:Q6581072.

There is “Getting started” documentation available at wikitech-wiki, and if something does not work as expected they help in the IRC channels. Once this is done, you can connect to the Toolforge console (login.tools.wmflabs.org, on Windows e.g. by using PuTTY) and do nano /data/project/bene/public_html/lonelyitems/index.php — or create your own tools. —MisterSynergy (talk) 06:44, 6 February 2018 (UTC) @MisterSynergy: Okay, I have created an account there and am awaiting approval of my membership request so that I can connect properly.

  } At one point in the past, the query could run for a long time but would still output results at the end. Now it terminates immediately, without any warning, irrespective of the parameters passed to construct the query itself. Do you or someone else familiar with connecting to (clone) databases know what the problem may be? Mahir256 (talk) 05:45, 8 February 2018 (UTC) No clear idea. Some files such as /data/project/bene/config.php are access-restricted for whatever reason, so we cannot look into them. Typically only ~/replica.my.cnf needs to have restrictive permissions (which it has by default), since it contains tool-specific database credentials. So I don’t fully understand how this tool connects to the database, the mysqli_connect_wiki() function is basically a black box. However, some weeks ago (November?) they have changed the aliases of the database hosts (see history of wikitech:Help:Toolforge/Database). I can’t tell whether the old ones still work, but this might be an issue here. —MisterSynergy (talk) 06:21, 8 February 2018 (UTC) @Mahir256: I managed to get a (temporary) clone of this tool running at tools.wmflabs.org/mstools/lonelyitems-clone/, with my own PDO database connector instead of Bene's approach.
