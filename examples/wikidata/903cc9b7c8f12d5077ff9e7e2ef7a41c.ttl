There might be a few other tweaks that could be done, notably for title (P1476). --- Jura 16:15, 19 January 2017 (UTC) Film descriptions in ['es', 'ca', 'gl', 'ast', 'an', 'ext', 'oc', 'it', 'pt', 'sv', 'de', 'nl', 'fr', 'he', ] Good news, I just noticed that Emijrp's Emijrpbot (talk • contribs • logs) adds descriptions to film items! The details are in film.descriptions.py.Personally, I added them in English once in a while. I try to follow the sample at WikiProject_Movies/Properties#Description, but skip any films that don't have both director and year. I also skip films with many directors, these are generally anthology films. --- Jura 07:52, 5 March 2017 (UTC) The Bot is blocked now due too high editing rate. Queryzo (talk) 08:45, 5 March 2017 (UTC) Yeah I noticed, but that's mainly a problem with the website and should eventually be sorted out. --- Jura 08:47, 5 March 2017 (UTC) Some time ago I added a lot of Italian description, now I use quickstatments and this Listeria list that I elaborate with a spreadsheet. --ValterVB (talk) 17:14, 5 March 2017 (UTC) Hello! Bot is unblocked now. I am open to add more languages to the script (the latest language added is Arabic). Your help is appreciated. Emijrp (talk) 14:54, 11 March 2017 (UTC)@Emijrp: Would Hungarian be too much of a stretch? If we were to use the same data, the others use, it would look like this: \"[Hungarian label of director] [year][suffix] filmje\". The language of the label is important when the director's name is originally in a non-Latin script, because Hungarian often uses its own transliteration, but it also cannot be omitted, because without the name the rest of the description won't make sense as \"filmje\" means \"film of/by\" so without the name it should only be \"film\". The suffix is always necessary but depends on the number. Thankfully, all numbers will be four digit, which simplifies the process: if the last digit is 1, 2, 4, 7 or 9, the suffix is \"-es\" (e.g. \"2011-es\"), if the last digit is 3 or 8, it is \"-as\" (\"1988-as\"), if the last digit is 5, it is \"-ös\" (\"1995-ös\"), if the last digit is 6, it is \"-os\" (\"1936-os\"), if the last digit is 0, you check the digit before that: if the last two digits are 10, 40, 50 or 70, it is \"-es\" (\"2010-es\"), if the last two digits are 20, 30, 60 or 80, it is \"-as\" (\"1960-as\"), if the last two digits are 00, you check the digit before that: if the last three digits are 100, 200, … 900, it is \"-as\" (\"1900-as\", really there cannot be any other as of now) if the last three digits are 000, since the maximum year is below ten thousand, it is \"-es\" (\"2000-es\", yet again, the only option). How do you like it? So a complete example would be \"Barry Jenkins 2016-os filmje\". :) (See also function 'hanyas' in hu:Modul:Nyelvtani modul.) – Máté (talk) 18:03, 11 March 2017 (UTC) Property for film script(s) Should we create a new property to link items about film scripts? This could be an item about an online version, a published version in book form, or the specific copy held by a museum or an archive. --- Jura 15:32, 12 March 2017 (UTC) Here it is: Wikidata:Property proposal/film script. --- Jura 06:09, 15 March 2017 (UTC) In the meantime, this was created as film script (P3816) and I made an initial list, mainly based on images at Commons: Wikidata:WikiProject Movies/lists/scripts. --- Jura 06:19, 28 March 2017 (UTC) Property for key film scenes? How could we integrate details on specific film scenes? --- Jura 09:17, 25 March 2017 (UTC) You can simply connect them with the part of (P361)/has part(s) (P527) properties, can't you? – Máté (talk) 11:34, 25 March 2017 (UTC) I don't know. Do you? --- Jura 11:36, 25 March 2017 (UTC) I agree with Maté. Here is an example for Dumbo's Pink Elephants on Parade-Scene: Pink Elephants on Parade (Q29021559). But maybe you have other details in mind?--Valentina.Anitnelav (talk) 11:44, 25 March 2017 (UTC) The item you just created looks good. It's even more developed than I had imagined. Currently we only have few similar ones (4): SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?itemDescription
{
	?item wdt:P31 wd:Q282939 . 
	SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en,en\" }
}
 Try it! None seems to be using has part(s) (P527) leaving these somewhat lost. Anthology films use P527 to link their parts. --- Jura 13:35, 25 March 2017 (UTC) Here is a list of anthology films currently using P527: Wikidata:WikiProject Movies/lists/anthology films. Shall we create a new property for scenes? --- Jura 03:50, 11 April 2017 (UTC) I have no strong opinion here, as I see no real advantage/disadvantage in retrieving information. Maybe it would be more intuitive and thus encouraging to add scenes if there is an own property. -- Valentina.Anitnelav (talk) 09:56, 14 April 2017 (UTC) Gaps == Active users == ValterVB LydiaPintscher Ermanon Mushroom Queryzo Danrok Rogi Mbch331 Jobu0101 putnik AmaryllisGardener Andreasmperu U+1F350 Bodhisattwa Shisma Wolverène Tris T7 Antoine2711 CptViraj ʂɤɲ Trivialist 2le2im-bdc Sotiale Wallacegromit1, mostly focus on media historiography and works from the Global South M2k~dewiki Rockpeterson Mathieu Kappler Sidohayder Spinster Gnoeee Ranjithsiji Ontogon Supaplex Carlinmack Haseeb Demadrend Jakeob9000 RealityBites Sriveenkat Keplersj dseomn Fuzheado BeLucky DaxServer PaperHuman JerimeeNotified participants of WikiProject MoviesObviously we don't cover every single (e.g.) British film nor include an item about every TV series episode. Also we have a quite a lot of property to describe these, but most items are far from complete.Besides that, I was wondering where you think we have substantial gaps (properties or items). At some point, I noticed that enwiki keeps deleting articles about Indian actors, but I don't think these were covered in other languages either. Maybe our coverage of (e.g.) Indian cinema could need improvement. --- Jura 06:32, 31 March 2017 (UTC) First of all we need to be sure, how many items we got about TV series episodes for example. This query is a good tool to add IMDb IDs on single series. Queryzo (talk) 12:49, 31 March 2017 (UTC) Here is a query that gives some measure about TV episode items. Comparison with other websites is another way to do it, but I'm more curious about perceived gaps \"besides that\". e.g. Nigerian cinema is said to be very prolific, but [1] finds only 152 today. The two previous topics above address other gaps. --- Jura 08:25, 2 April 2017 (UTC) On Multichills disk page, we have created a new query using number of episodes (P1113) to get a list of the series with most missing IMDb IDs or items. So there's the question f.e. if we want to have all episodes of The Bill (Q929589) in Wikidata (2412 items). Queryzo (talk) 15:08, 23 April 2017 (UTC) For some series, enwiki has episode summaries in lists. It would be great if we could somehow get to retrieve these with the items if we create them. Otherwise the items are just a list of episode title translations (at least, until you split them by language). --- Jura 04:50, 1 May 2017 (UTC) Festivals and its award(s) Items used: film festival (Q220505)   Properties used: instance of (P31)   , has part(s) of the class (P2670)   """@en;
