On this feedback loop page, we presented our first batch of references and collected many useful comments.Following up on the topic, we improved our data batch based on your feedback. On top of that, we created a distributed Wikidata game called Reference hunt!. With this game, you get a suggestion of an Item and a reference based on structured data from an external website. You can accept the reference if it is good (it will then be added on Wikidata), reject the reference if it is not fitting, or pass if you are not sure.Feel free to try the game and give us feedback on this talk page! We will also track the edits made by the game with the tag reference-game and monitor the results (how many times people click on accept or reject on a suggested reference) to analyze the overall quality of the data batch.Cheers, Mohammed Sadat (WMDE) (talk) 11:39, 25 May 2020 (UTC) I think it would make sense to show the user some context for the claim. Maybe the sentence in which the \"extracted data\" appears. Without context it's hard to say whether the extraction worked well. In addition it would be great to only show users references in languages that the user can understand. My abilities to read Korean are very limited. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 11:53, 25 May 2020 (UTC) Thanks for your feedback. Since the extraction happens using \"hidden\" markup in the source code of the website, it is tricky to show the exact context. But we can do some more. Unfortunately, it is not possible at the moment to only show users references in languages that they know, it's best to skip these references and let them be handled by someone who speaks the language. Mohammed Sadat (WMDE) (talk) 10:58, 28 May 2020 (UTC) Thanks for this game. It is quite cool how you could collect the data for this game. As ChristianKl suggested, providing some context for a claim would improve the game a lot. For example, if the extracted data is a date, I'll have first to open the source URL to check whether the date is a date of birth, date of death or some other date. --Pasleim (talk) 14:17, 25 May 2020 (UTC) Or worse, many users won't open the URL and think that the tool got the interference right even when it hasn't. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 17:49, 26 May 2020 (UTC) Tracked in Phabricator Task T253839 Pasleim, ChristianKl: we're taking this into account. Mohammed Sadat (WMDE) (talk) 12:39, 28 May 2020 (UTC) @Ladsgroup: This tool created duplicated reference on Eduard Einstein (Q118253). Please check.--GZWDer (talk) 19:33, 25 May 2020 (UTC) @GZWDer:Thanks for your feedback. This has now been resolved and it should not happen anymore. Mohammed Sadat (WMDE) (talk) 12:42, 28 May 2020 (UTC) Pretty cool, but so far not very game-like. Do you have a game designer consultant who's working on adding encouragement and rewards and fun surprises? Especially important because properly verifying the references is slow -- there is pretty much no way around reading the source page carefully in 95% of the ones I've done so far. I have some suggestions: In order to properly manage the data, you should have two yes/nos for \"is it reliable source\" and \"does it support the claim\" rather than combining them. If a significant number of players thought the reference source was not reliable, you can take it off your list. And if a certain source is getting lots of \"does not support,\" you can re-evaluate how you extract data from that source. Thank you for your feedback Levana Taylor! Unfortunately the Wikidata Game does not support this and we're just hooking into it. But we are looking at the declined references to figure this out anyway. Just a bit more manual work. At some point in the future, you could check if the user has Babel set up and only give them references in languages which they said their ability was at least level 2. And when they log in, ask them if they have Babel and if not, have a link to how to do it. If they don't have it show them any language. As far as we know that's not possible, but we'll look into it more. If you're only hunting references for claims that currently have no references, can you also hunt for ones where the only reference is \"imported from Wikimedia project\"? I know that might be tricky. Levana Taylor (talk) 14:36, 28 May 2020 (UTC) These are already being taken into account as well. - Mohammed Sadat (WMDE) (talk) 08:51, 2 June 2020 (UTC) Commons Special:MediaSearch or search Commons in any language Hoi, Special:MediaSearch provides a working search interface. It is a prototype, it supports any and all languages and it is imho the best new functionality for our movement in a long long time.. What I would like for myself is a link like I have for Reasonator. I did find that you can tweak the results in Commons. For instance Mr Frank Vera is linked through \"depicts\" on Commons and among a lot of noise it is at least the first result.Please have a look and please consider how it enables anyone to find pictures in any language. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 16:03, 30 May 2020 (UTC) testing I'm generally impressed. But let me give you a few terms that didn't have great results, because that might reveal some issues to be looked into: Piața Revoluției - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MediaSearch?type=bitmap&q=Pia%C8%9Ba+Revolu%C8%9Biei No idea why all the art that comes up first picior - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MediaSearch?type=bitmap&q=picior Romanian for 'foot', no results at all! Kopf - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MediaSearch?type=bitmap&q=Kopf what's with the airplanes; almost no heads... grain photography - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MediaSearch?type=bitmap&q=grain+photography Nothing obviously germane; 'grain photograph' brings up an entirely different set of images, no more obviously related to the concept of 'grain' in photography. 暢庭 - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MediaSearch?type=bitmap&q=%E6%9A%A2%E5%BA%AD Got very different results than 陈宜禧 - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MediaSearch?type=bitmap&q=%E9%99%88%E5%AE%9C%E7%A6%A7 -, although I'm pretty confident they are the same person, Chin Gee Hee - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MediaSearch?type=bitmap&q=Chin+Gee+Hee. Some small overlap in the results. But on the whole: at least 4 out of every 5 searches I tried in a variety of languages got me good results. - Jmabel (talk) 17:12, 30 May 2020 (UTC) Some more attempts that didn't work well: Cleveland Ohio band 1980s - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MediaSearch?type=bitmap&q=Cleveland+Ohio+band+1980s Got entirely one band (Cutumay Camones). No Devo. No Cheap Trick. No David Thomas. Women music 1980s - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MediaSearch?type=bitmap&q=Women+music+1980s Mostly not on the mark Seattle music 1980s - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MediaSearch?type=bitmap&q=Seattle+music+1980s Got a bunch of pictures from the now-demolished Fox Theatre, known in that era as the Music Hall. For some reason, the CDC Boys do show up, as does Tony Benton, but not a great set of results. - Jmabel (talk) 21:36, 30 May 2020 (UTC) This is the first prototype, it works after a fashion and it brought to us warts and all. It is a mix of wikidatified material that includes a \"depicts\" statement in Commons and texts with labels superimposed. There is no display like in Hay Kranen's SDSearch.. When a user named \"Katze\" uploaded hundreds of files, it prevents German people from a nice display only with cats. When you look for something and there is no label for an item in your language, you will not find it. So add a liberal sprinking of labels and this search engine will do much better .. You have to wait for the label to make its way into the search engine though.. In my experience so far, it works best for very concrete subjects. People, taxons, building. There is no true querying available so this is as good as it gets for now. It is a prototype and for me it is the best thing that happened to the Wikimedia Foundation since Wikidata took over interwiki links. This makes us more of a movement. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 17:06, 31 May 2020 (UTC) @GerardM: Do I take that to mean, \"No, I don't want feedback on where it fails\"? - Jmabel (talk) 15:37, 1 June 2020 (UTC) @Jmabel: Feedback is good. Given that it is a prototype, and is branded as \"it just works\", it follows that it does not fail. It just does not work as we could hope for. Therefore what is needed is to find in what way it does work and where it needs improvement. There are a few things I have found: there are text that should not be considered in a multilingual search/search - usernames there is a need to only show the images that have been tagged as well as there is a need to show off the smarts of the search engine (I am impressed) I am particularly interested in the multi lingual aspects of it all, it requires a lot more labels for it to be useful in most languages. There is anecdotal evidence that an additional label for one scientist invites updates on dozens of pictures. The name used on images was different from the name in English.. Potentially we are talking dictionaries per language - How will that affect the performance of Wikidata? - How will that affect the performance of Commons? Search needs descriptions in order to disambiguate. The quality of descriptions in Wikidata proves that they will not scale to 300+ languages. For me there is only one realistic solution; generated descriptions, preferably runtime. There are user stories for different usages. Think GLAM, think Commonists working on license info, think Wikipedians looking for alternate illustrations. user stories should not be in the format of \"I want something for my community\" it is better to say \"I need to show all material provided by the \"Tropenmuseum\" (or any other GLAM). \"I need to show all material for Batavia sorted by date\". \"I need all the representation of a particular artist\" etc. Potentially even pictures of English Wikipedia can be included so that we can start managing \"fair use\" material. It helps a lot when tests include links to the search involved. One \"nice to have\" thing is to indicate the language the search is for. I am expansive in my reply because feedback is so vital. I have played with the issues that were raised. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 17:32, 1 June 2020 (UTC) I would suggest that usernames should not be entirely eliminated, but should require a qualifier (e.g. \"username:\"). Often searching on a username is very useful for those of us actually active on Commons. I didn't initially provide links above, but the search strings were verbatim. I've now added the links, if that's the preferred way for you to get this. - Jmabel (talk) 01:49, 2 June 2020 (UTC) Regensburg Classification (P1150) Why are listed at Wikidata:WikiProject_Books#Work_item_properties only Dewey Decimal Classification (P1036), Library of Congress Classification (P1149), Chinese Library Classification (P1189) and Universal Decimal Classification (P1190), but not Regensburg Classification (P1150)?Rather Regensburg Classification (P1150) has conflicts-with constraint (Q21502838) book (Q571) and magazine (Q41298).--Nstrc (talk) 08:03, 31 May 2020 (UTC) See Property_talk:P1036#Distinct_value_constraint_and_conversion_to_external-id_datatype. --- Jura 08:38, 31 May 2020 (UTC) \"Proposal B can be viewed just as a transition towards the elimination of library-classification properties on publications, in order to supersede them with zentrales Thema (P921).\" I totally disagree with the idea, that only main subject (P921) should be used for categorising the content of books (or essays). A certain subject can be analysed by different academic disciplines, e.g. there is a difference, whether a book, which deals with soccer, is classified as * UDC 79 \"Recreation. Entertainment. Games. Sport\" (cfr. LCC GV \"Recreation. Leisure\") * UDC 33 \"Economics. Economic science\" * UDC 94 \"General history\" (cfr. LCC D \"History\") or * UDC 34 \"Law. Jurisprudence\" (cfr. LCC K \"Law\"). Rather than aiming to eliminate library-classification properties on publications, I would prefer, I could use not only Dewey Decimal Classification (P1036), Library of Congress Classification (P1149), Chinese Library Classification (P1189) und Universal Decimal Classification (P1190), but also Regensburg Classification (P1150). Cfr. as well (unfortunatly in German): Wikidata:Forum#Unterschied LoC-Klassifikation - RVK. --Nstrc (talk) 13:08, 31 May 2020 (UTC) PS: Regarding Regensburg Classification (P1150): @Kolja21: - because of 19. Februar 2014, 07:06 (\"new: P1149, P1150\") and Property proposal/Archive/19#RVK-Notation (10. Februar 2014, 19:26]: \"Pretty helpful if you visit an institute library in Germany. You'll find your literature much faster.\" --Nstrc (talk) 15:31, 31 May 2020 (UTC) Dewey Decimal classification is of somewhat limited usefulness because in the old days, a lot of libraries did their own assigning of classifications to books so they'd vary widely. I don't known whether that's still current practice. But I can certainly see replacing that one with main subject (P921) -- legacy being the only reason it's kept. For LOC, though, you can look up what the Library of Congress itself uses, and so fewer libraries would disagree with it. From what Nstrc says, it sounds like all German libraries use a unified Regensburg classification. So yeah, in general classifications are useful info to have and are not at all the same thing as main subject (P921). Why not keep identifiers for classifications used by major national library systems? Levana Taylor (talk) 16:52, 1 June 2020 (UTC) Facilitate discussing an edit Hello. The history tab of an item contains next to each edit an undo and a restore link. When clicking either one is offered a text field where one can explain the action. Confirming the action notifies the editor who performed the original edit. This workflow, once discovered by an editor, makes it easier (if not even incentivizes) to ask about a not-so-obvious edit by undoing it.How about a discuss link next to each edit which: creates a new section on the item's talk page links to the edit notifies the user who did the original edit Thanks. Toni 001 (talk) 08:32, 1 June 2020 (UTC) Seems like a good idea. I would also add on my wishlist: \"be able to see the history, but just for 1 property\". It is kinda tedious to check the whole history when you just want to know when 1 property was changed, and filtering didn't look obvious to me (maybe there is a trick I do not know). --Misc (talk) 10:37, 1 June 2020 (UTC) Support for \"be able to see the history, but just for 1 property\" --Haansn08 (talk) 06:04, 2 June 2020 (UTC) Discussing an edit seems to me like a general discussion feature that should be of a task of the working group that takes the next stab at reimagining discussions on MediaWiki and not a WikiData specific thing.

Thank you ! Bouzinac (talk) 07:40, 2 June 2020 (UTC) Do you mean subclass of (P279)? production company (P272) seems unlikely to be confused. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 08:58, 2 June 2020 (UTC) Yes, sorry, it was a typo. Bouzinac (talk) 09:12, 2 June 2020 (UTC) Bouzinac: I understand what you are writing, please understand that the type of diplomatic mission should be included in this point. Undoing the edit will not resolve the issue. It’s more important to be in it — even if you’re in the wrong place — than not to be in it.We have talked about this before, I wrote even then: be sure to have a consulate, a consulate general, a commercial representation, and so on. Palotabarát (talk) 11:14, 2 June 2020 (UTC) subclass of (P279) is not appropriate for stating the type for items that aren't themselves classes. If you want to state that Consulate of the United States, Tabriz (Q20986676) is a consultate you can say Consulate of the United States, Tabriz (Q20986676) instance of (P31) consulate (Q7843791). ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 12:08, 2 June 2020 (UTC) Using Wikidata to create COVID-19 per capita data table I'm trying to create w:Template:COVID-19 pandemic data/Per capita using Wikidata data (see my current early efforts at the sandbox, and lmk if you'd like to help). I'm having trouble retrieving the most recent case count, though, since unlike country population data, the most recent value doesn't seem to be ranked as preferred. How do I get that to happen? Sdkb (talk) 08:17, 2 June 2020 (UTC) How to specify that a given infrastructure is a proposal/project and not an operating infrastructure? I found several infrastructures that are not already existing but are projects/proposals which may (or may not...) exist in the future. The issue is that I can't find a way to differenciate them from real operating similar infrastructures. Examples are Q67130279 or Q56063893 which are two projects of spaceports in Europe not yet agreed. I'm looking for a way to flag this fact but can't find anything on the documentation. Is there a qualifier I can add to an existing 'instance of' statement, like 'status'? Or am I supposed to replace existing 'instance of' with 'project' (or proposal? or something else?) with a qualifier 'of' 'spaceport'? Or is there a property to state that the whole item is a proposal? Thanks in advance for your help. Romain2boss (talk) 12:36, 29 May 2020 (UTC) Use state of use (P5817). --Jklamo (talk) 17:13, 29 May 2020 (UTC) Thanks for your answer. You mean a new statement state of use (P5817)=project (Q170584)? Looking at their wikidata pages I'm not sure it fits well. I mean that its is not really 'used' and the definition and examples given are about existing infrastructures that are or have been used. Can you please point me to somewhere where I can make sure that it is a wellspread use in this context? If this is the case I think state of use (P5817) definition and examples should be extended to include project state. Romain2boss (talk) 20:42, 29 May 2020 (UTC) Finally I used state of use (P5817)=proposed building or structure (Q811683) and am adding an example on property page. Romain2boss (talk) 20:35, 2 June 2020 (UTC) Tags I noticed that english wikipedia have a tag called \"possible BLP issue or vandalism\" and i was wondering if this tag exists on WD as well. --Trade (talk) 22:06, 1 June 2020 (UTC) We could create the tag, but the point is that on ENWP it is added by three specific edit filters, and those filters cannot readily be applied to Wikidata content. If you have a sample set of edits that reflect similar problems, we could try creating edit filters. Bovlb (talk) 01:03, 2 June 2020 (UTC) \"If you have a sample set of edits that reflect similar problems, we could try creating edit filters.\" tho edits i had in mind have been supressed for obvious reasons. --Trade (talk) 01:31, 2 June 2020 (UTC) I think the tag should be edits on an item that is likely to be about a living person of a statement with a property that has living people protection class (P8274). ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 08:57, 2 June 2020 (UTC) Bovlb I was referring to edits such as this.

Eurohunter (talk) 20:25, 2 June 2020 (UTC) The Q-ID counter is at ~96.00M; according to my counting, there are actually ~86.81M items, ~2.87M redirects, ~1.40M deleted items, and ~4.93M Q-IDs that have been omitted (i.e. the items have never existed, just as Q96000000). The number given on the Wikidata:Main Page, currently ~87.11M, is close to ~86.81M, but for some reason somewhat different—I have no idea how it is calculated. :-) —MisterSynergy (talk) 21:48, 2 June 2020 (UTC) Applicablity of RfP voting eligibility I have striken Nnadigoodluck's vote at Wikidata:Requests_for_permissions/Oversight/Kostas20142 as this user does not have 100 local non-automated edits. In two recently closed RfCU requests the user Operator873 is also ineligibile to vote. Does community agree with this? On the other hand as CU and OS requires 25 supports having this requirement may let CU and OS requests a (very little) bit more difficult to succeed.--GZWDer (talk) 07:27, 27 May 2020 (UTC) Given that we have the 100 local non-automated edits for admins I see no reason why we shouldn't have the same limit for CheckUsers and Oversighters and Support adding it.

If I wanted to stand up a new Wikibase (Q16354758) specifically oriented around collecting and storing data for a specific type of item (e.g. a database of productivity software (Q7247856)), is there a path where that data would be searchable / integrated into the main Wikidata instance?I've seen multiple references to being able to link datasets, but I'm not sure it's very clear how that process works? Can someone shed some light on it for me?- AlphaWeaver (talk) 12:22, 29 May 2020 (UTC) @AlphaWeaver: There are definitely plans for this but I think it's still in early stages. See Wikidata:Federation input for a discussion here on what is needed. That said, I think you can implement federation at the level of SPARQL queries now, if that's sufficient for your needs. ArthurPSmith (talk) 17:42, 29 May 2020 (UTC) @AlphaWeaver: Initial development efforts toward Wikibase federation are on the Wikibase roadmap for 2020/2021. Making it possible for one Wikibase to access via API the entities in another Wikibase (e.g. Wikidata) is something we are currently working on in a series of phases. Phase one has been underway since late February, and it consists of making it technically possible to access properties from one Wikibase to reuse in another. We started with properties for a variety of reasons, including stronger Wikibase user demand and [relatively] less technical complexity to develop. The problems we need to solve to enable users to access ~8000 Wikidata properties is on a different scale entirely than the problems we need to solve so that users can access millions of Wikidata items in a stable and reliable way. We strive to make significant progress on this topic in 2020! Samantha Alipio (WMDE) 11:10, 3 June 2020 (UTC) New feature to be developed: Simple Query Builder Hello all,The development team is currently doing research on how to improve the experience of the Query Service for people who don't have knowledge about SPARQL. After evaluating several ideas and asking for your feedback, we decided to focus on providing an visual interface for people who would like to build simple queries, for example for maintenance. You can find the detailed announcement on this page.We are looking for people to test our first prototype! We are especially looking for people that have a solid understanding of Wikidata’s data model but that don’t necessarily have a lot of experience with using SPARQL. More details on the page linked above.

Beyond angle from vertical (P4183), a few other properties could be useful. I'm interested in more suggestions.A query displays a few others. --- Jura 11:55, 4 June 2020 (UTC) Which topics would like to see Wikidata Tours for? Hi allAs you may know Wikidata:Tours are a really great way to learn about aspects of Wikidata, however there are a small number of tours and until now no clear way to create them. Navino Evans and myself have created a comprehensive guide on how to create Wikidata Tours with a space to collaborate with others to build tours and to suggest tours you'd like to see. We hope that increasing the number of tours available for new users will be able to learn how to contribute more easily and add data more consistently making queries more reliable.Please take a look and: Suggest tours you would like to see available, this can be anything from technical aspect of Wikidata, how to create a specific kind of item e.g a person, museum etc or a specific task e.g add a date of birth. Share existing guidance on different aspects of Wikidata that could be turned into a tour. Start writing new tours. If you know Javascript you can help transform a tour draft from a page of text into a working tour. Thanks very much--John Cummings (talk) 18:58, 21 May 2020 (UTC) I think it could be beneficial to newer editors to provide a tour on creating literary source items (i.e. creating the work level item and edition level item and linking them, to use the edition as a reference). It can be a confusing concept to encounter for the first time and I didn't fully grasp the distinction until I understood certain properties can only apply to edition level items (e.g. an ISBN or a publisher). --SilentSpike}} (talk) 10:19, 22 May 2020 (UTC) Nevermind, I see suggestions should be made in the table on the page linked! --SilentSpike (talk) 10:24, 22 May 2020 (UTC) @SilentSpike: thanks very much for the suggestion, I'd be happy to work with you to put together a tour on this, I don't understand the topic well at all so if you could create a draft I can edit and make into the tour format (there's a proforma for a tour linked to from the design and write sections of the instructions). --John Cummings (talk) 15:56, 25 May 2020 (UTC) Would there be any possibility of getting phab:T246814 resolved before we add more tours? We don't want to waste the time of Recent Change patrollers. Bovlb (talk) 19:45, 1 June 2020 (UTC) @John Cummings: Forgot to ping OP. Bovlb (talk) 15:53, 4 June 2020 (UTC) @Bovlb: thanks for the suggestion, I really want this to be fixed also but I don't know who would be able to or what skills would be needed. Do you know which software is effected and who is responsible for it if it is maintained by WMF or WMDE etc? --John Cummings (talk) 15:57, 4 June 2020 (UTC) @John Cummings: From the discussion so far, there seem to be two proposed solutions: Add an edit filter that checks the item id against a hard-coded list and adds a tag. Any admin can do this, but we would need to (remember to) update the filter whenever we create new topics. Change the WikiTours interface to add a tag. This would be the more elegant solution, but would require work from a WikiTours interface developer. I don't know who that is, and I don't know how to find out. Bovlb (talk) 16:07, 4 June 2020 (UTC) Thanks @Bovlb: could you share this on phabricator? It seems sensible to centralise the discussion there. --John Cummings (talk) 16:27, 4 June 2020 (UTC) @John Cummings: Done. Bovlb (talk) 16:47, 4 June 2020 (UTC) Deletions of in use items because they do \"not meet notability policy\" uses Q90739444 WikiProject sum of all paintings, strives to \"get an item for every notable painting\", and hundreds of thousands of paintings on Commons rely on data pulled from Wikidata. We encourage people to update the metadata about artworks on Wikidata instead of on Commons. That is why I found it quite troubling that some pages on Commons were broken because items on Wikidata were deleted due to lack of notability. More specifically I noticed pages searching for Q92121816 and Q90739444, which were deleted by User:Pasleim. I had to look up Wikidata:Notability policy again and it is unclear if they meet the policy. Those paintings do not have \"valid sitelinks\" (very few paintings do) so we have to rely on case #2 with \"clearly identifiable conceptual or material entity\" provision. For a painting to be notable, it must be possible to \"described [it] using serious and publicly available references\". In case of those 2 items, it is possible to describe them using references, like this one for Q90739444, but whoever created the item did quite a sloppy job and did not add any references or sources. So here is the problem, We can not be deleting items used by other projects to store metadata about distinct objects, even if those items do not meet our notability criteria. On Commons we have policy that if image is used on any project than it is \"in scope\" and will be hosted on Commons (assuming it also has valid license) I think we need something like this here that if item is used by other project to store metadada than it is in Scope. --Jarekt (talk) 03:09, 24 May 2020 (UTC) We need to avoid circular policies. If Commons has the policy that each image is in scope which is used on any project, and Wikidata would have the policy that items for images on Commons are notable, then vandals just need to create both image and item at the same time and thus they are notable both projects. The above mentioned items were deleted because they were created by a globally blocked user. Such actions need to be possible independent of any Commons usage. --Pasleim (talk) 06:42, 24 May 2020 (UTC) @Jarekt: I noticed it too and started Topic:Vmw7njupwlcqez67. Pasleim messed this up and should undelete it instead of trying to talk themselves out of this, that will only make things worse. Just restore the incorrectly deleted items. Multichill (talk) 08:44, 24 May 2020 (UTC) @Multichill: You have also reverted edits by the blocked user [2]. Do you prefer that I restore all items created by them and then revert their edits afterwards? What is your opinion about edits like this? Is it okay that users can create new items on Wikidata, even if their are known to create hoaxes and blatant wrong statements for years and across many projects? --Pasleim (talk) 09:00, 24 May 2020 (UTC) The standing of the user does not have anything to do on notability of the items they create. The items were sloppily created, but we still need them and they should be improved not deleted. Is there a policy that makes items created by banned users not notable? --Jarekt (talk) 12:11, 24 May 2020 (UTC) Wikidata has currently no way to check the use of items at Wikimedia Commons. As long as this isn't possible, Commons contributors need to be aware of that and moderate their use of otherwise unused items. Commons developers are aware of the problem. --- Jura 12:18, 24 May 2020 (UTC) Sloppy creations and sloppy deletions. The baby has been thrown out with the bathwater. Assuming the question asked by Jarekt is not rhetorical: No such policy exists. I see that undeletions slowly have started. Wikidata:WikiProject sum of all paintings/Creator/Giambattista Pittoni needs checking when that is done. @Jura: your remark doesn't make sense in this context because the items linked to Commons using image (P18). Multichill (talk) 12:32, 24 May 2020 (UTC) Good point. I withdraw it. The question seems to be if blocked users can continue to edit or not.--- Jura 12:39, 24 May 2020 (UTC) Disallowing a user from editing is the whole point why a user get blocked. If a user manages to evade a block, it is obvious that edits must be reverted and page creations deleted. English Wikipedia has a policy for this [3] but such a policy is unnecessary as it is common sense that block evasions are not tolerated. --Pasleim (talk) 17:19, 24 May 2020 (UTC) Pasleim, I am not aware of any policy allowing deletion of otherwise fine items because one of the contributors is banned. Q90739444 had 4 contributors (including Multichill), why are you deleting their contributions? It is a waste of time for other contributors to help with an item which is than deleted to make some banned user fell bad. If you need to delete someone's contributions than it is fine, just replace them with your own. --Jarekt (talk) 00:09, 25 May 2020 (UTC) I deleted only items where the banned user was the main contributor. I would say, on average 90% of the edits were made by the banned user, 9% by bots and 1% by other users. Q90739444 has one edit by BotMultichillT. Item with a greater contribution from other users I did not delete. --Pasleim (talk) 04:38, 25 May 2020 (UTC) Speaking as a Commons admin, there is really a fundamental choice here. As Jarekt says in his initial remarks, we on Commons have been encouraged to update the metadata about artworks on Wikidata instead of on Commons. If Wikidata does not consider Commons' usage a sufficient criterion to keep an item, then we on Commons should stop doing that. There is already a lot of skepticism about Wikidata (and even more about structured data for Common) from a lot of Commons users. If you want to address that skepticism, you pretty much have to accept Commons as a legitimate client whose needs must be met. If you don't want to, then please stop suggesting that Commons lean more and more on Wikidata and Wikibase. - Jmabel (talk) 17:20, 24 May 2020 (UTC) Is there any Wiki project that doesn't have something against WD?--Trade (talk) 17:24, 24 May 2020 (UTC) Also on Commons, edits by the here mentioned globally blocked user were reverted on grand scale [4]. --Pasleim (talk) 17:53, 24 May 2020 (UTC) Wikidata does indeed consider Commons' data usage usually as a sufficient for notability, but there are simply cases where Commons does a poor job as well. As this should not be a rant about the Commons project and I think that both projects should drastically improve collaboration with each other, I am not going to list the details here again. Yet, sometimes a deletion seems appropriate regardless of linked Commons data; content of a problematic user, such as in this case, could in fact be such a situation. That said, once someone offers to review and verify the deleted items, I think they should be undeleted and improved. The concept of notability in Wikidata refers to a technical form that items should have (basically being identifiable and verifiable, based on serious sources), rather than being a measure for admissibility based on intrinsic properties of the described subject. With that in mind, one can understand more easily why quite a lot of items qualify for deletion, although the described entities would certainly be admissible if only a proper item was created. —MisterSynergy (talk) 18:12, 24 May 2020 (UTC) I Strong oppose mass revert or deletion of edits by (whether locally or globally, whether by admins, community, or WMF) blocked/locked/banned users (they may be discussed in their own merits, as if they are made by normal users), for the following reasons: Wikidata data may be in use by various projects (including those the users are not blocked, and non-WMF ones) and deleting them defeats the propose. Protection, blocks, etc. should be trected as technical measure to improve the data quality. If the quality is OK there is no need to delete or revert them. This also applies to edits that can be improved latter. In Commons there is strong consensus not to delete any contribution of blocked users. In Chinese Wikipedia (potentially positive) contributions of blocked or even WMF banned users are not removed at all, and the community treats deletion of contribution of banned as killing every child born in violation of one-child policy (Q221719). Note only WMF is obliged to WMF bans; nobody else are required to revert edits by banned users.--GZWDer (talk) 18:28, 24 May 2020 (UTC) I can't see the Wikidata items, did they display the image in the image field? --RAN (talk) 01:57, 26 May 2020 (UTC) RAN yes they dis have image (P18) statements. --Jarekt (talk) 20:50, 26 May 2020 (UTC) Pasleim, The deletions of items because they were edited by undesirable users, is not one of the allowed deletion rationales stated in Wikidata:Deletion_policy#Deletion_of_items. We still need those items. Do we undelete, create new ones from scratch, or should we delete statements by offending party and recreate them? How do you want to proceed? Keeping the original item ID would allow less changes on Commons, but I am OK with creation of new items and redirecting.--Jarekt (talk) 21:03, 26 May 2020 (UTC) Just undelete them, every item should be kept/deleted on their own merit, not who created them. --RAN (talk) 21:18, 26 May 2020 (UTC) @Jarekt: I can offer to create new items by bot, if for the paintings external sources exist. Not only with focus on Pittoni, but generally for all missing paintings. --Pasleim (talk) 11:59, 27 May 2020 (UTC) @Pasleim: The items should be undeleted and then improved.--GZWDer (talk) 12:42, 27 May 2020 (UTC) I just discovered a whole lot more of those deleted items, removing metadata from bunch of files on Commons. Some of those files had contributions from several named users including me. So far I undeleted the metadata of the following files, deleted by Pasleim since they did \"not meet notability policy\", despite the fact that most of them had independent sources and all were being used : Q67203092 The Sacrifice of Polyxena (Q92121816) The Sacrifice of Jephtha's Daughter (Pittoni, Southampton) (Q91049784) Feretory with the Annunciation (Q90739444) San Domenico (Q91048123) The Nativity (Q91850846) Those few items were among 300 other items deleted for lack of notability in the same couple days. To me all of those seem notable and all were being used, so I am still concerned that there is some misunderstanding about our notability policy. I do not have time to check 300 other items but many were works by Giambattista Pittoni and our list of his works shrank considerably in last few days. Pasleim, Can you un-delete all the other items for artworks, by notable artists like Pittoni deleted by you in the end of May. That way, community can more easily decide if any of the artworks are not notable? --Jarekt (talk) 04:17, 3 June 2020 (UTC) @Jarekt: I think you can undelete it now unless Pasleim opposes undeletion.--GZWDer (talk) 16:58, 5 June 2020 (UTC) I was undeleting them, each time I run into a file on commons which suddenly points to a deleted artwork item, but I am working on something else and wanted to avoid crawling through 300 deletions to see which ones are out of scope (some definitely are) and which are OK? Also I do not want to be doing this work if Pasleim is going to be deleting perfectly good items. I am also concerned that undeletion of the item does not restore all the links to the item which might have been deleted. Anybody knows how to look for those and restore them? --Jarekt (talk) 17:31, 5 June 2020 (UTC) tourism slogan Would it be correct to use the property motto text (P1451) [or motto (P1546) for when the motto itself is notable enough to have its own WD item] to include city/region/country tourism slogans (with 'start' and 'end' date qualifiers when appropriate)? Here is an English Wikipedia list for every country's current tourism slogan. We DO already use this property for places' formal mottos (e.g. France (Q142) -> Liberté, égalité, fraternité, and United States of America (Q30) -> E Pluribus Unum), and we also already use the Properties for commercial advertising slogans (e.g. McDonald’s (Q38076) has it for 5 different languages). So, is it appropriate to use the Motto properties for tourism campaign slogans alongside these more formal mottos at the same time, or should they be separate with a different property? Furthermore, would that extend to cities and regional tourism campaign slogans, such as I Love New York (Q1353042)? If it's not appropriate to 'mix' the 'formal motto' and the 'tourism slogan' of places, should \"tourism slogan\" be a separate property?? Wittylama (talk) 13:02, 29 May 2020 (UTC) I think the question is whether an entity would be likely to have both a \"slogan\" and a \"motto\", or if that's only a rare case where the same property for both would be fine? To me it seems like they would be generally clear from context so using the same property should be fine (i.e. add \"tourism slogan\" as an alias for the motto properties). ArthurPSmith (talk) 17:39, 29 May 2020 (UTC) Pretty common to have both. E.g., for Virginia (Q1370), \"Sic semper tyrannis\" sends a pretty different message than \"Virginia is for lovers\". - Jmabel (talk) 22:35, 29 May 2020 (UTC) Could we allow both on the same property and distinguish type of slogan/motto/etc by qualifiers where relevant? This would also let us encompass things like slogans used to market to investors, which are probably different from ones used to market to tourists. Andrew Gray (talk) 10:04, 2 June 2020 (UTC) Here's a practical example now in use - with the 'latin motto' and the 'tourism slogan' next to each other for the item New York (Q1384): Q1384#P1451. If you think that is confusing and needs to use separate properties, or needs qualifying somehow to differentiate them, please advise. Wittylama (talk) 10:16, 2 June 2020 (UTC) I've now made a batch-edit (featuring my first use of OpenRefine for reconciliation!) via QuickStatements to add everything from this table of national tourism slogans on English Wikipedia, to their respective country's wikidata items using the property motto text (P1451). It's an edit to 132 items with two edits - one for the string of text, and one for the \"imported from Wikimedia project -> English Wikipedia\" reference. example from the item Albania. Notwithstanding I gave the quickstatements batch a name, it still appears in the edit summary as: \"#temporary_batch_1591202694827\". Once the batch has finished, the next question is how do I query for these to visualise on a map, in such a way that it brings the tourism slogans, not the 'formal' Latin mottos? Wittylama (talk) 16:56, 3 June 2020 (UTC) @Wittylama: This query will get \"all values of P1451 that have their language set to 'en'.\" (I haven't written the rest of it yet). However, a problem emerges pretty quickly - on for example Q31#P1451 or Q25#P1451, we have an English translation of the \"formal\" motto, plus the English-language tourism motto. Whether those should be there or not is another question (a translation isn't the same as the official motto) but it points up why specific qualifiers might be helpful, especially if the official motto is actually in English! :-) In terms of what qualifiers might work, perhaps object of statement has role (P3831) pointing to a new item such as \"official motto\" or \"tourism slogan\"? Andrew Gray (talk) 19:48, 3 June 2020 (UTC) Object has role -> tourism slogan works nicely, yeah. Is it possible to all the statements I’ve just created - and not the other ones you’ve identified in that query - in order to mass-add that qualifier? Wittylama (talk) 20:13, 3 June 2020 (UTC) Not easily from my end (the query service doesn't know edit histories) but if you have the list you uploaded it might be possible to re-run it through QS or similar with the relevant qualifiers added? That will probably add them to the existing claims. Andrew Gray (talk) 20:15, 3 June 2020 (UTC) I've set up some examples of qualifiers at Q1370 and adjusted the constraints accordingly. This query has all the current subclasses of \"motto\" - we have national motto (Q29654714) which would probably do for the main ones, but no generic \"official motto\". Andrew Gray (talk) 20:27, 3 June 2020 (UTC) @Andrew Gray: I worked out how to run a mass 'undo' on the batch (fortunately I hadn't closed the tab), added the relevant qualifier statement to all the items and re-exported to quickstatements. I ran a batch of a single item - Albania - and it worked well Q222#P1451. So, I then ran it for all the rest... and broke. Most annoyingly, it broke in an inconsistent way: sometimes not adding the reference, sometimes not adding the qualifier, sometimes neither, sometimes both. So, I 'undid' that batch too. here's the OpenRefine project if you feel like having a look at the 'schema' tab. Wittylama (talk) 22:52, 3 June 2020 (UTC) @Wittylama: unfortunately that's a link to your local OpenRefine install :-). If you can get it to export a simple file (csv? excel?) with item name + desired motto text and email it over I can do the upload from this side for you. Andrew Gray (talk) 17:44, 4 June 2020 (UTC) Ah, sorry Andrew Gray, I had assumed an OpenRefine project was visible if you shared the URL, like googledocs. Here's the code, formatted for Quickstatements: https://pastebin.com/2fCXV5eg . It's really quite a simple batch - each item gets a single statement, and all of them get the same single qualifier and reference. I've stripped away things like 'start date' and former slogans that appear in some items in the original table on En.WP for simplicity's sake. I've also stripped all en.wp's references because they're to each country's tourism website, not a reference to the slogan's existence itself. So, I don't understand why such a simple batch would fail in such varying ways.... Wittylama (talk) 14:02, 5 June 2020 (UTC) @Wittylama: I'm beginning to suspect it was nothing more than coincidental QS problems! I'm running the batch locally (albeit very slowly) and it seems to be working OK. Map with coordinate points & English tourist logos Map with shapefiles & English tourist logos I haven't filtered it to just countries as for the moment it's only showing them anyway (plus Virginia, which we added earlier). Andrew Gray (talk) 16:55, 5 June 2020 (UTC) Integration of 20th Century Press Archives (Q36948990)'s country/subject archives metadata A draft for the integration of the large archives' metadata (> 280.000 articles in 9000 digital folders) into Wikidata is outlined here, linking to details of the proposed data structure. Feedback is very welcome - cheers, Jneubert (talk) 09:24, 2 June 2020 (UTC) Is Germany : Individual diseases and their control (Q91257808) meant to be a topical item or just some group of files in said archive? Depending on the approach, the use of \"location\" and \"has part\" seems a bit odd. --- Jura 09:39, 2 June 2020 (UTC) It is meant not as a topical item (\"real world object\"), but represents the folder for the clippings (= digitized files) collected under that designation. These folders are sometimes rather artificial and may contain material about different items (e.g., 1918-1920 flu pandemic (Q178275), cholera (Q12090) and other diseases). Jneubert (talk) 10:03, 2 June 2020 (UTC) For Q91257808, wouldn't \"main subject\" be more appropriate for statements like \"location = German Reich\" and \"has part = 1918-1920 flu pandemic\". --- Jura 09:22, 4 June 2020 (UTC) Well, \"location\" is not a perfect fit here. It would be great to have a property like Dublin Core's dcterms:spatial - however, I was not able not find anything similar among Wikidata's properties. I would have used country (P17), if not some of the \"countries\" were cities (like Hamburg), regions (like Northern Europe, or the world) or groups of countries (like \"Russion peripheral countries\"). In my eyes, main subject (P921) would be under-specific here - due to the structure of the archive, each instance of PM20 country/subject folder (Q91257459) is defined by exactly one \"country\" and one PM20 subject category (Q92707903). In the future, this structure should be supported by a ShEX schema and according validation. Having a mix of different geographical and topical items in \"main subject\" would make that much more difficult. The use of \"has part\" is different. In the folder, clippings about dozens of different diseases have been collected. The subject \"cholera\", for example, applies only to a sequence of 7 documents, whereas the other 604 documents in the folder have no informationj about cholera. So this is really a subdivision, not a \"primary topic\" of the whole folder. You are right that the disease itself (cholera) is not a part of this folder. I suppose the formally correct thing would be to create an item for each subsection, e.g. \"Germany : Individual diseases and their control - cholera\". But I think that would be overkill. The downside of the \"has part\" shortcut however is that the inverse relation is not true (cholera is not \"part of\" that PM20 folder). I can imagine that could mess up completely unrelated queries about diseases, which rely on the inverse relation. So perhaps using \"has part\" is not such a good idea. Is there any property for \"subtopic\"? Could it make sense to propose one? Jneubert (talk) 17:35, 4 June 2020 (UTC) QuickStatements thankyou Thanks to whoever tuned up QuickStatements.

Sdkb (talk) 06:55, 3 June 2020 (UTC) Some kind of bot / script, I guess. Ghouston (talk) 07:01, 3 June 2020 (UTC) Maybe a query used in w:Template:Wikidata list is more suitable.

Is my post at WD:Request a query the right place to go to ask for the bot? Sdkb (talk) 03:56, 5 June 2020 (UTC) @Sdkb: Wikidata:Bot requests is probably the best place to go - query requests is more for \"I'd like to know the answer to this\" as you can't actually edit through the query service. Unfortunately it's a little outside my competence to write a script for it, but hopefully someone there should be able to help. It might also be worth leaving a note at Wikidata talk:WikiProject COVID-19 if you're not already in touch with them, as they may also have been thinking about the same problem. Andrew Gray (talk) 09:08, 5 June 2020 (UTC) How to track datasheets and reference manuals? Hi,In the properties proposal, there are several properties for identifiers in various external systems (book shops, museums, etc).However this probably assumes that the URL doesn't change over time, or that if it changes over time, it can just be updated, without necessarily needing to keep a history of URLs and versions of the page.system on a chip (Q610398) and various other hardware components have hardware documentation which in many cases comes in the form of a technical reference manual, at a given URL which is publicly accessible, in the pdf format.These documents are crucial as without them there are many things that you cannot understand: Software and hardware documentation relies on them They are referenced in many projects source code such as the Linux kernel (Q14579), Das U-Boot (Q1170607), sometimes with an URL and sometimes just by the name of the PDF files. However: Companies making hardware components are bought, merged, change strategies with regard to accessibility of information, etc. So the URL tend to move around, and sometimes document can even disappear if they are not archived by archive.org for instance. The PDF are typically updated over time and have versioning information in a given pdf. Older PDF are sometimes very relevant as sometimes information is removed in the newer ones. Would Wikidata be adapted for archiving the version and URL of such documents?If so what would be the way to represent something like that for a given company like Freescale Semiconductor (Q863675) which is now part of NXP Semiconductors (Q1155668), or Texas Instruments (Q193412) ?GNUtoo (talk) 05:01, 4 June 2020 (UTC) @GNUtoo: I think trying to describe them on the level of the manufacturing company is probably unmanageable, given presumably you have one datasheet per component (or series?), and a large number of components per company? I can see two possible practical ways to do this: a) Use described at URL (P973) on the item about the particular component, pointing to a URL for the manual, with appropriate qualifiers (publication date (P577), edition number (P393), archive URL (P1065) etc). Add new URLs with new sets of qualifiers as needed for different versions. object of statement has role (P3831) can be used to say \"this is a data sheet (Q1172383)\" (etc) if it's useful to distinguish between links. b) For a more detailed approach, create an item for the manual itself, and link to the manual using full work available at URL (P953), with qualifiers as above. Link from the component item using described by source (P1343). The first of these is probably more straightforward, though I don't know if we have a massive number of items for the right types of thing yet... Andrew Gray (talk) 17:36, 4 June 2020 (UTC) \"Current Uses\" in property discussions Hello, for some time now, the \"Current uses\" row in {{Property documentation}} seems to give a wrong number by quite a large margin. For example, it says 583,402 at Property talk:P691 but it's actually closer to 375,342 (based on this: https://w.wiki/T2T) or possibly 376298 (based on this: https://w.wiki/H5t). Any idea what might be causing it? If this is difficult to fix in the short-term, maybe we should hide the corresponding row in {{Property documentation}}. --Vojtěch Dostál (talk) 08:55, 5 June 2020 (UTC) @Vojtěch Dostál: It’s probably counting qualifiers and references as well.

 Try it! – 583415 is close enough to 583402 that I think the difference can be ascribed to edits that were made since the bot last updated the usage data.

Does anyone know how best to encode a participant in such an activity/role? -- The Anome (talk) 12:09, 5 June 2020 (UTC) I feel like Wikidata uses \"occupation\" as a very broad term (maybe because nobody ever made anything else). For example bird watcher (Q84321442) is listed as an occupation even though it really isn't. I mean human activity (Q61788060) seems like a good fit but then you won't be able to tag humans with it in a sensible way. Maybe we should just broaden occupation and accept it lists anything they do even non-professionally. Or else make a new property for non-professional activities they engage in (but what would you call it?). BrokenSegue (talk) 15:28, 5 June 2020 (UTC) It's worth noting that adding information about unpaid activities on BDSM play parties comes with huge privacy concerns. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 19:44, 5 June 2020 (UTC) Concur with ChristianKl.

Even if a court case rules that the original claim is libel, the rumour will persist and may end up in one of our data sources. From Hill To Shore (talk) 02:05, 6 June 2020 (UTC) Or, more reliably but I still think we shouldn't use it, if it came up in a court case in testimony (e.g. a liability case related to an accident at a club). - Jmabel (talk) 03:17, 6 June 2020 (UTC) Frivolous or occasional occupations should be used with caution: they will be blindly regurgitated in infoboxes across the Wikimedia ecosystem, no matter how trivial, and will be propagated through every source that draws from Wikidata. The concept of 'definingness' should be invoked: is the subject commonly and consistently known as a dungeon monitor, or did they just do it once or twice? Many people have worked as a cashier (Q1735282) or waiter (Q157195) before becoming notable as an actor (Q33999) or politician (Q82955), and adding trivial occupations (even if verifiable) would be more noise than signal, pollution in my opinion. -Animalparty (talk) 00:12, 6 June 2020 (UTC) I feel like we are stsrtig to get off topic--Trade (talk) 01:53, 6 June 2020 (UTC) Updating Wikidata:Database reports/Constraint violations/P952 I have made many edits on items who has ISCO-88 occupation class (P952) the two last days, but I can not see that Wikidata:Database reports/Constraint violations/P952 is updatet as required.

How can we avoid the creation of QIDs such as Q32927605, or at least find an easier way to delete them after maintenance? Such items shouldn't be created, right? In this instance, I deleted the only linked category on enwiki today, which is how I stumbled over this QID. Rehman 11:56, 8 June 2020 (UTC) We have established workflows to bring such items to admin attention without any user action being necessary. It usually takes a couple of days until these items are deleted, sometimes a bit longer. But we do not pile up any significant or concerning number of such cases. ---MisterSynergy (talk) 12:08, 8 June 2020 (UTC) Thanks, MisterSynergy. Would you be able to link me to the page/discussion regarding this process please? I'm interested to know how this works. Cheers, Rehman 12:18, 8 June 2020 (UTC) Per Wikidata:Notability/Exclusion_criteria, they may be deleted if they have only one sitelink. If totally empty they will be listed in Wikidata:Database reports/to delete/empty category items.--GZWDer (talk) 18:05, 8 June 2020 (UTC) (Edit conflict) It is not a formally defined process, more like a set of individual routines developed over time. There is for instance the bot maintained work list User:Pasleim/Items for deletion/Page deleted on which items appear from which the last sitelink has been removed; this is also the case for the mentioned item Q32927605. Some admins regularly work on this list and remove most incoming items timely. There are also several Listeria lists containing for instance \"emty category items\", \"empty template items\", and a couple of other similar meta stuff (see Wikidata:Database reports/to delete, and some others are in user space as well). Mind that there is no requirement for a deletion discussion before a deletion is being done at Wikidata, so the removal of such items that are clearly no longer necessary is a process which barely anyone takes notice of most of the time. —MisterSynergy (talk) 18:08, 8 June 2020 (UTC) Thank you for the replies, GZWDer and MisterSynergy. Good to know this. Cheers, Rehman 02:26, 9 June 2020 (UTC) Research Projects on Wikidata Hi All,As far as I know, more and more research projects decide to use Wikidata, either creating their research data directly here or just link it to their own database. Still, if I want to see a list of these projects or I want to know how to bring a new research to Wikidata, my options are Wikidata:WikiProject Wikidata for research or somehow finding a WikiProject initiated by academics.For example the COURAGE project about cultural opposition created a amazing set of data here, yet you can only stumble upon it through digging in the data. This lack of transparency makes it difficult for non-academic users and researchers to \"see\" each other or even work together.I think there could be a separate page, reachable from the main page and the left toolbar, which would serve as a directory for research projects. Here projects could have Mediawiki pages with a short description, members, official sites, queries listing all their edits, etc. A new property could also link the projects' item to these pages. It would also provide great visibility to Wikidata as a research platform or tool, and perhaps the new pages could even serve as places where members of the research teams could communicate.What do you think?Best, Adam Harangozó (talk) COURAGE is a project where it's creators don't think there relationship with Wikidata is important consider it to be a partner or otherwise mention it's relationship to Wikidata on their mainpage. I don't see why Wikidata should list it prominently. Ghazalgf created the property proposal for the relevant external ID property and seemed to added data. He hasn't written anything on his user page that he speaks for COURAGE and provide the transparency you are looking for. Wikidata already has enough channels for people who want to collaborate to do so and adding additional channels risks diluting the existing ones. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 16:09, 8 June 2020 (UTC) COURAGE was just an example, though I don't believe that we should point fingers at research projects saying it's their responsibility to communicate when nothing tells them how to on Wikidata (Still they even wrote an article about using Wikidata). There might be many channels but that doesn't equal quality communication and if you look at the page as an outsider, and as the example of COURAGE shows, it would help if there would be a central space for research projects. --Adam Harangozó (talk) 16:40, 8 June 2020 (UTC) Could you define what you mean with \"Research project\"? ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 21:33, 8 June 2020 (UTC) According to the terms of use of Wikimedia it's responsibility of users who makes edits to disclose when they are paid for those edits. COURAGE seems to be a project that's paid by a grant and thus there's a responsibility for disclosure which is not happening.

Scope and Content as a qualifier for Archives At Hello, Why is scope and content not allowed as a qualifier for Archives At? If you have archives at an institution and are allowed to list the title of the archival collection and its URL, why would you not want the collection’s scope and content included therein? This allows researchers to know if they should follow the link or not to the collection. Scope and content helps explain the title of the archival collection at a particular institution. Thank you, Jane Two items on separate print copies of same portrait Hi. I have just stumbled across Sir John Owen Knt (Q55008437) and Sir John Owen Knt (Q55008452) which describe separate print copies of the same portrait in the Welsh Portrait Collection (Q54859927). Should the items be merged as copies of the same portrait or should they be retained as describing separate print copies? If they should be kept separate, what justification would be best to use on different from (P1889)? From Hill To Shore (talk) 01:50, 6 June 2020 (UTC) I've now found a third item on a print of the same portrait; Sir John Owen (Q77435063). From Hill To Shore (talk) 02:19, 6 June 2020 (UTC) And Sir John Owen (Q55006249) makes four. From Hill To Shore (talk) 02:27, 6 June 2020 (UTC) You might get better answers at Wikidata talk:WikiProject Visual arts, but keep in mind, nobody really knows anything, and Wikidata in many ways is a gigantic stumbling toddler. Anything goes, really, until it doesn't. Books can have separate editions, sculptures can have separate castings, and prints can have as many copies as lithographers or Xerox machines allow. Some copies are in libraries with fancy accession numbers. Some are scanned on Internet Archive. Some are on my wall or in millions of books in bookstores and libraries around the world. -Animalparty (talk) 07:20, 6 June 2020 (UTC) My vote is to merge, since they are all the same page from a book. The entry would then show each collection that has a copy, but this is just my opinion. Think of it as a book, multiple identical copies, not new editions, that may have a different forward or corrections made. . --RAN (talk) 07:47, 6 June 2020 (UTC) The question occasionally comes up and, depending on how much one thinks knowing about the print(s) and their basis, different approaches are suggested. The current situation for the above is standard if one starts with a \"bottom up\" approach. It's fairly easy to do when one just describes a single print (or thousands of prints in a given collection). If you merge them, you'd need to change P31 to P279. Would the identifiers then be kept or deleted (or qualified somehow)? Also, you could end up doing separate subclasses for some of the cases mentioned or variations of the image. --- Jura 09:27, 6 June 2020 (UTC) print (Q11060274) is already a group of works, not just one copy, as a subclass of work with multiple executions (Q28886448). Peter James (talk) 12:51, 7 June 2020 (UTC) Interesting point, especially as work with multiple executions (Q28886448) has group of works (Q17489659) instead of work (Q386724). I don't think the description of print (Q11060274) reflects that nor contributors who add prints are aware of that. Probably Q28886448#P279 needs fixing. --- Jura 05:00, 8 June 2020 (UTC) Since these prints come from the collection of the National Library of Wales (Q666063), you should check with their Wikimedian in residence (@Jason.nlw:) before doing any merging. Dogfennydd (talk) 07:36, 7 June 2020 (UTC) Hi all. This issue has come up before, and i understand the desire to merge, however from our point of view we would prefer them not to be, as the data items describe two different unique physical artifacts in our collection, each with their own catalog entry. Like other GLAM's we have started round tripping our Wikidata to power or enrich other services such as this, so from our perspective and probably other GLAM's who share on Wikidata, merging multiple catalog items would be problematic. Happy to discuss best way forward though.Best Jason.nlw (talk) 10:53, 11 June 2020 (UTC) The new domain structure for tools fails us - Reasonator among others no longer available Hoi, Reasonator no longer works. This is the Phabricator ticket. What is the plan to bring back functionality that is broken by what to me is a cosmetic change. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 11:14, 8 June 2020 (UTC) So, I can't really say if that's the reason, but having different sub-domains usually do help from a web security point of view, since cookies would no longer be shared with all applications if configured correctly. With the previous system, someone finding a XSS bug in a application could have escalated to access all others applications in the domain with XHR. Having separate domain mean that CORS and others policies could be deployed to protect from that.--Misc (talk) 11:44, 9 June 2020 (UTC The rationale for a change in domain is not relevant when a tool is not available. What is relevant is that Reasonator is now available again and as important, the huge amount of Reasonator URL are automagically translated into the new domain. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 11:57, 9 June 2020 (UTC) \"The rationale for a change in domain is not relevant when a tool is not available\"; yes it is Gerard. You might not be privy to the rationale or perhaps understand it, but it IS relevant. I know you care, but some things just don't happen instantly and/or perfectly. We are standing on a swamp of volunteer labor here, ppl have day jobs to attend as they do this on the side and wikimedia engineers have credentials to protect from people who register for the tool services with the sole goal to get access to non-public information. And when these 2 things combine, then sometimes something is offline for a bit. TheDJ (talk) 12:48, 9 June 2020 (UTC) There is a difference between a rationale for a change and, arguably tools have improved significantly, and acceptance for an essential tool not to be available. What we have is that support for understanding the information in a Wikidata rests on tools like Reasonator. It is imho the best of breed when you want to understand our data in another language than English. It is telling that we rely on what is described as a \"swamp of volunteer labour\" for essential functionality. What Special:MediaSearch Commons provides us is an option to give a use for the labels in Wikidata and find material in any and all languages. When we are to support the sum of all knowledge to everyone, this enables us to \"ensure that \"All of Commons is available to every single person on the planet\". So yes, I care but what we do has to have a purpose. It is not only to bring the fastest queries to white dudes who understand SPARQL and support special interests that exist in our data.

Some of the people in the list are living people. But the query only finds people with the word \"slave\" in a label, description or alias, so there is no reason to assume that they are slave traders. Some can be slaves themselves, some can be known for helping slaves, some can be named \"Slave\" in their own language, or the word could mean anything else in some languages.

There were instances where the names were exactly the same, yet the search results showed a non-match. Is there something we can do to improve the results for such instances? Some examples that we encountered where our labels are exactly the same as that in wikidata: “Dick Lee”; “S. Rajaratnam”; “Zouk”.To refine the search, we have tried adding “Singapore” under the property “Country” (see table below) as a parameter to increase the probability of a match, but it does not seem to work. Singapore Infopedia ID Singapore Infopedia Title Country SIP_1595_2009-10-30 Dick Lee Singapore Example Example Example – The preceding unsigned comment was added by 116.88.233.116 (talk • contribs) at 14:45, June 10, 2020‎ (UTC). @116.88.233.116: OpenRefine does not (and cannot) auto-match when there is more than one Wikidata item that has a high (96% or more?) matching score; you will have to look at the list of possible matches and find the one that is really the same. If you have additional fields (like country) do make sure you are matching to the correct Wikidata property - in the case of Dick Lee (Q710609), for example, the relevant property for you would be country of citizenship (P27) and not country (P17). ArthurPSmith (talk) 17:01, 10 June 2020 (UTC) Duplicate Entities A question that we get asked by our colleagues is how does Wikidata prevent the creation of more than 1 Wikidata records for the same entity? For example, if a record has been created for Gregory Peck (actor), there will not be another record with a different “Q” identifier for him. Presently, is some bots/technology being applied to prevent this from happening? – The preceding unsigned comment was added by 116.88.233.116 (talk • contribs) at 14:47, June 10, 2020‎ (UTC). There are no technical processes stopping the creation of duplicate items (after all, there presumably are multiple people called Gregory Peck...), but there are various active measures that help ensure it doesn't happen or that it's caught and the records are merged reasonably quickly: Wikipedia links. Two items can't link to the same Wikipedia item, so if you try and link your new page to w:Gregory Peck you'll quickly discover it's a duplicate. Similarly, there's a presumption that anything with a Wikipedia page will already have an item, so for most things which are \"prominent enough\" you'll know to look for a match rather than assume you need to create a new item in the first instance. Internal links. It is quickly apparent that if we have two Gregory Pecks listed on the cast for To Kill a Mockingbird (Q177922), there must be something wrong. So hopefully once you start linking the new item to/from other items, it will become clear there's an issue. Identifiers. Most identifier properties have reports set up to spot two items with the same ID, so if you try and link your new Gregory Peck to his IMDB entry, it'll flag it up as a probable error needing reconciled, because two different people shouldn't have the same IMDB ID. Date matching. Reports like Wikidata:Database reports/identical birth and death dates/1 will spot that there are two people born on 5 April 1916 & died on 12 June 2003 - these can then be manually checked to see if they're the same person Human observation - if all else fails, there's a good chance that someone looking for Gregory Peck's Q-number will spot that there are two of them and get it fixed. As you can see, not all of these are likely to work in all circumstances, but if we have more than a minimal amount of data on the new item, they're likely to work. If we just have two entries with no metadata barring a name, it's more likely they'll be missed and remain unmerged. The best solution, of course, is for people to screen new items before creating them to make sure they're not a duplicate! Andrew Gray (talk) 15:23, 10 June 2020 (UTC) It's worth noting that an entry that just contains the name of a person and no metadata could be refering to multiple different people and thus doesn't fulfill our notability guidelines, so it's likely going to be deleted. In addition to what Andrew said, we also don't allow two items with the same name and description. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 20:31, 10 June 2020 (UTC) Yes, I forgot this one, though it's a very narrow technical limit - \"John Smith / artist, 1880-1950\" and \"John Smith / artist (1880-1950)\" would be allowed even though to a human they're basically the same, as would two items called \"John Smith\" with no description at all. It can certainly help flag up some duplicates, though! Andrew Gray (talk) 21:23, 10 June 2020 (UTC) Extended search I have looked to items about laws, bulletins and other things related to laws.

 Try it! @Jura1, Fuzheado: thank you very much! --Pablo Busatto (talk) 16:24, 11 June 2020 (UTC) Type constraint false positives (not respecting class inheritance) Why is Q1304258#P669 showing that Adenauerallee (Q355872) should be an instance of a subclass of geographical feature (Q618123) when it already is? It's an instance of street (Q79007) which you can see is a subclass here: https://w.wiki/UCW --SilentSpike (talk) 17:55, 15 June 2020 (UTC) The type constraint is about the item not the value. --SCIdude (talk) 19:59, 15 June 2020 (UTC) Ah, I noted on the talk page that this seems confusing, as it is being referred to as a faculty of law AND as a building. I see now that the error states \"but Q1304258 currently isn't\", and I assumed that Q1304258 was Adenauerallee and not the Juridicum. Any chance of using something like Juridicum (Bonn) (Q1304258) here, to make this clearer? --WiseWoman (talk) 20:11, 15 June 2020 (UTC) Only slightly embarrassed I overlooked this in my haste 🤦‍♂️ --SilentSpike (talk) 20:15, 15 June 2020 (UTC)  I think that this discussion is resolved and can be archived. If you disagree, don't hesitate to replace this template with your comment. SilentSpike (talk) 21:46, 15 June 2020 (UTC) coordinate location (P625) constraints and mappings Hi, stumbled across longitudes > 180 (San Pablo-Toledo Magnetic Observatory (Q59508672)), which I changed: [5] to map the latitude to [-180°,+180°]. The problem occurs on the map, where a second planet is used to show longitudes > 180 (There is no second planet). I would assume that there are similar flaws when sorting coordinates, checking nearby etc. This is not an exceptional case: #defaultView:Map

 Try it! Questions: Is a longitude of >180° and <=360° a legal value in some contexts? Or is this a broken contract? How should wikipedias using such values proceed? What is the range of coordinate location (P625)? Adding longitude > 360° is rejected, but 180° < longitude <= 360° is not? Similar a latitude of > 90° or < -90° is not rejected, but should be: There is nothing above or below the poles (while for a longitude > 180° there is a possible interpretation). How to proceed?: Fix the rendering of longitudes by converting all values into [-180°,+180°] in the code for coordinate location (P625) or Tighten the constraint for longitude (I did not find any range constraint in the meta data) and Change the values manually / per bot to map into the usual range. and technically: How to get all longitudes >180° or <-180°, see next post. best --Herzi Pinki (talk) 06:58, 11 June 2020 (UTC) Coordinates may be used for other astronomical bodies, like the Moon or Mars. mw:Extension:GeoData#Glossary provides some information. Wikidata is meant to reflect information in sources, where possibly invalid values may come up, that's why entering invalid values is allowed, too. --Matěj Suchánek (talk) 09:31, 11 June 2020 (UTC) I added a complex constraint to P625. It lists some 50-100 coordinates from Earth with >180°. Interestingly, mapping with OSM still works, see e.g. Q59508735#P625. --- Jura 11:10, 11 June 2020 (UTC) checked some of the geohack listed apps. the following fail with longitude > 180°: google maps wikimap does not show the pin nearcoord fails with explicit message Special:Nearby commons on OSM does not show images while [6] does. So I fear that allowing longitude > 180° breaks the contract. --Herzi Pinki (talk) 20:27, 11 June 2020 (UTC) How to proceed? Fixing all the apps above (and more) or changing the rendering of longitudes lon > 180° to lon-360°? --Herzi Pinki (talk) 19:39, 12 June 2020 (UTC) I think they are mostly magnetic observatories. @Trilotat:: would you double-check your additions? --- Jura 20:44, 12 June 2020 (UTC) Get all longitudes > 180° fails I want to retrieve all longitudes > 180° (of coordinate location (P625)) with sparql but do run into a timelimit.

 Try it! any idea? --Herzi Pinki (talk) 06:58, 11 June 2020 (UTC) According to Wikidata:Database_reports/List_of_properties/Top100 there are >8 million P625 claims in WD.
