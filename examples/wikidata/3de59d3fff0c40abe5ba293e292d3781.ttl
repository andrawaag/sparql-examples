 Try it! --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 10:21, 1 February 2021 (UTC) I see that Tagishsimon and I essentially made the same two queries. The main difference, as I see it, is that Tagishsimon used query hints to prevent the optimizer from doing unwanted reorderings of the queries, while I inserted seemingly unnecessary OPTIONAL clauses with the same purpose. Both methods are fine. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 10:37, 1 February 2021 (UTC) Thank you both for the queries. 3300 results for the first and 60 for the second, uff! I will look at the 60 results and maybe resolve them, but for the 3300 I think a bot is necessary. Steak (talk) 11:58, 1 February 2021 (UTC) Hmm. How will the bot know whether to change the rank or remove the reason? --Tagishsimon (talk) 12:11, 1 February 2021 (UTC) Good question :) Let's not bother us with such problems, may someone else clean up this mess. ;) Steak (talk) 15:08, 1 February 2021 (UTC) MWAPI Woe Joost van den Vondel (Q312673) - a human with an English label turns up in SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?typeLabel WHERE {

 Try it! What exactly is the wikibase:api \"EntitySearch\"; searching, that it finds a bunch of Vondels but not Joost? I've failed to find the answer from https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikidata_Query_Service/User_Manual/MWAPI#Supported_services or https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikibase/API#wbsearchentities --Tagishsimon (talk) 23:25, 1 February 2021 (UTC) Ah. M'learned colleague @generalising points to a limit of 50 on EntitySearch, which err, probably answers most of the question. --Tagishsimon (talk) 00:00, 2 February 2021 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: EntitySearch uses the API function \"action=wbsearchentities\" which has the documentation page https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?action=help&modules=wbsearchentities As the doc says the max number of results (the \"limit\" parameter which is set to \"max\" as default) is 50. But the real problem is that MWAPI doesn't make continuation calls to get the next results, as it does with other types of services. The API does offer continuation calls for wbsearchentities but the syntax is different from that used by the \"Generator\", \"Categories\" and \"Search\" services which all is built on the \"action=query\" type API call, and MWAPI isn't coded to do wbsearchentities continuation calls. You could file a wish to make wbsearchentities continuation calls on Phabricator. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 01:28, 2 February 2021 (UTC) Wikidata items I created Is it possible to get a list of items I created? —Michael Z. 00:32, 2 February 2021 (UTC) @Mzajac: Yes, but it wouldn't be possible with the query service if you had created many items.

That is great! —Michael Z. 03:49, 2 February 2021 (UTC) Query labels in multiple languages in one request Hi there,I am new to sparql and struggling with finding a query that outputs the labels of an item in several lunges in one result set, including the related language code. I know how to indicate a language code in a query, e.g. 'en' OR 'fr'. However I'd like to receive both 'en' AND 'fr' in one result. Ideal would be a query, returning the labels in all available languages.I did see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikidata_Query_Service/User_Manual#Basics_-_Understanding_Prefixes - this only seems to return one language at a request.Thanks for your help! Hi. This query shows how to get labels in English and French for two items: SELECT ?item ?label_fr ?label_en
WHERE
{
  VALUES ?item { wd:Q3736439 wd:Q34384 }
  OPTIONAL { ?item rdfs:label ?label_fr . FILTER (LANG(?label_fr) = \"fr\") }
  OPTIONAL { ?item rdfs:label ?label_en . FILTER (LANG(?label_en) = \"en\") }
}
 Try it! And this query shows how to get all labels with corresponding language code for an item: SELECT ?item ?label ?language_code
WHERE
{
  VALUES ?item { wd:Q3736439 }
  ?item rdfs:label ?label .
  BIND (LANG(?label) AS ?language_code)
}
 Try it! --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 10:51, 2 February 2021 (UTC) Thank you very much! This works great :) Help needed with Commons query I have a query for looking for files on commons that have multiple coordinates of the point of view (P1259) statements: SELECT ?file (COUNT(?coord) AS ?count) {
	?file wdt:P1259 ?coord .
} 
GROUP BY ?file 
HAVING ( ?count > 1 ) 
LIMIT 100
 Try it! Unfortunately it is timing out. Is there some way to fix it? I also tried: SELECT DISTINCT ?item  ?statement WHERE {
	?statement wikibase:hasViolationForConstraint wds:P1259-fd02cded-4d91-994a-43c1-2c983a1f0a23 .
	?item ?p ?statement .
}
 Try it! To see if I can query for constraint violations. It does not work and I am not sure how to fix it. --Jarekt (talk) 19:00, 2 February 2021 (UTC) @Jarekt: 1) Note that if multiple truthy statements have the same property and value, there will only be one triple with the wdt: prefix, so the query above wouldn't find all files with multiple P1259 statements even if it didn't timeout. For instance c:File:Castanet le Haut Croix de Mounis Espinouse.JPG with 2 of each statement would never be found by the query. 2) Next, there are p.t. 13,286,112 triples with p:P1259, and 13,262,721 triples with wdt:P1259 in WCQS. The high numbers makes it hard to avoid timeouts. I doubt it is possible to do a \"GROUP BY\" as above with so many statements. A query like this SELECT ?file ?coord1 ?coord2
{
	?file wdt:P1259 ?coord1 , ?coord2 .
    FILTER (?coord1 != ?coord2)
} 
LIMIT 100
 Try it! runs in approx. 45 seconds, while SELECT ?file ?coord1 ?coord2
{
	?file p:P1259 ?coord1 , ?coord2 .
    FILTER (?coord1 != ?coord2)
} 
LIMIT 100
 Try it! runs in 2 seconds. The latter is so much faster because there are many more cases (because of point 1) so much fewer files have to be looked at to find 100 cases. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 20:46, 2 February 2021 (UTC) I was today years old when I discovered that ?item wdt:P31 ?thing1, ?thing2 was a thing. --Tagishsimon (talk) 20:56, 2 February 2021 (UTC) Really? That use of comma, called object lists, can be a nice shorthand form, but is never necessary to use. It is no secret though. See for instance wikibooks:SPARQL/Sentences#Comma, Semicolon and Period or Wikidata:SPARQL tutorial#Advanced triple patterns. In the official SPARQL definition it is found in the section https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#objLists --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 21:15, 2 February 2021 (UTC) Much of what I know comes from lurking on this board. Cannot say I've ever spotted the comma being used here. Thx, btw, for a couple of other of your answers on MWAPI and hint:maxParallel 50, both appreciated. And the 'Wikidata items I created' query, which has moved my understanding of wikibase:api \"Generator\" . on /very/ slightly. --Tagishsimon (talk) 22:14, 2 February 2021 (UTC) Dipsacus fullonum that is quite disturbing news as each file is supposed to have a single coordinates of the point of view (P1259) statement, and we seem to have multiple thousands. Thank you for your help identifying the issue. I to have never seen coma in SPARQL query. --Jarekt (talk) 02:43, 3 February 2021 (UTC) Female form of label Hi, in this sample I like to show, in a single colum, the P106 label when P21 = male (Q6581097), or the ca lang of P2521 (if exists) when P21 = female (Q6581072). #female form of label

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 22:38, 5 February 2021 (UTC) Looks like that did the trick. Thanks!.--Wolbo (talk) 23:09, 5 February 2021 (UTC) Here's my EC. I'm a bit concerned there may be a diversity of ways in which \"won a singles title at a Grand Slam event\" is represented; here's the pattern established for the 2018 Australian Open – men's singles (Q46993124) which is part of 2018 Australian Open (Q42557150) which is an instance of 2018 Australian Open (Q42557150) which is part of Grand Slam of tennis (Q102113). If other competitions don't have this part of/instance of/part of path, then their winner will not turn up in the report. This is not an update of your report; there was little in that to be salvaged. SELECT distinct ?person ?personLabel ?age

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 22:18, 4 February 2021 (UTC) It doesn't look like the second part of the UNION has any results at all. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 22:54, 4 February 2021 (UTC) Tagishsimon, thanks for the effort! The relationship as you describe it is correct apart from your second mention of 2018 Australian Open (Q42557150), which should be Australian Open (Q60874). That pattern should be the same for all four Grand Slams events (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open).The result of your query seems to be identical.--Wolbo (talk) 23:09, 4 February 2021 (UTC) Items used: tennis player (Q10833314)   , men's singles (Q16893072)   , Grand Slam of tennis (Q102113)   Properties used: occupation (P106)   , date of birth (P569)   , winner (P1346)   , point in time (P585)   , competition class (P2094)   , part of (P361)   , instance of (P31)   """@en;
