 Try it! This tells me if Tomorrow Is Yesterday (Q5252917) has the English title \"Tomorrow Is Yesterday\". But I don't care for the language. I want to find any identical string. Just removing the @en suffix, won't yield any results. --Shisma (talk) 07:45, 4 July 2021 (UTC)I've found the answer myself: SELECT ?stmt WHERE {
  wd:Q5252917 p:P1476 ?stmt.
  ?stmt ps:P1476 ?vl.
  FILTER (str(?vl) = \"Tomorrow Is Yesterday\")
}
 Try it! --Shisma (talk) 08:45, 4 July 2021 (UTC) congrats! Sometimes it helps to spell out the question to find the answer. --- Jura 13:18, 4 July 2021 (UTC) Split a query output into two or more lists Hi:We use this query to generate eswiki anexes: """@en;
