 Try it! The logical thing would be to think that the first result should be Alpha Centauri A (Q2090157) (since it is the closest to Earth), but in reality is COSMOS2015 489026 (Q75031832) which is 0.15 kiloparsec. Is there any way to detect the distances expressed in parsec and kiloparsec to convert them to light years? Otherwise, the distance from Earth (P2583) should be added in each star both in light years and in (kilo)parsecs and choose from the query which to use.--190.139.216.64 02:25, 20 February 2020 (UTC) There are two possibilities.

 Try it! I have limited both queries to 100 results before sorting because theywill timeout without a limit. There are 1,542,325 stars in Wikidata. I think it is impossible to search them all and convert the units in 60 seconds using SPARQL. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 05:15, 20 February 2020 (UTC) The most time-consuming part of the queries is the FILTER function (when removed its run almost instantaneously). Ideally, all these distances (light-year (Q531), parsec (Q12129), kiloparsec (Q11929860) and megaparsec (Q3773454)) should be stored in the database instead of being calculated on the fly and that everyone chooses the unit they prefer, I think that would improve the execution times of the query.--190.139.216.64 13:18, 20 February 2020 (UTC) Probably it's better to use \"wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q523\" as not all the stars have preferred \"Q523\" value. Also do you want e.g. brown dwarf (Q101600) (one is very close to the Sun)? They are even technically not stars... --Infovarius (talk) 10:14, 3 March 2020 (UTC) Most common kinds of items and what are the most common statements for them? I want to write some instructions for new contributors Hi allI'm not sure exactly what query I'm looking for but I'm working on schemas and other instructions for new contributors and I really like some information on common kinds of items so I know what people want to work on. What I would like to know is what are the most common 'kinds' of items are, as these, I guessing, are probably what they will want to create an item for. I guess this could be measured in a couple of different ways Most common statements overall (this will be useful for quick instructions for themed editathons etc) Most common 'instance of' Other very common statements and the most common values for those statements I assume there are a lot of people on Wikidata, to break this down a bit, what are the most common statements for people and what are the most common values? Once there's a list of the most common 'kinds' of items what are the most common statements for them e.g What are the most common statements for scientists?

The majority of sitelinks goes to Wikipedias anyway, so the filter uses time without limiting the results much. There will only be Wikipedias among the 15 first results, but if you increase the limit you can always add a filter after the grouping and counting by using subqueries – or take out unwanted results manually. Without filter and with P17 (country) changed to P27 (citizenship) I could run the query in 32 s without timeout. For items in USA (using P17) I think you have to query more specific subgroups in each query by adding more conditions with e.g. P31. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 22:42, 2 March 2020 (UTC) How to query all places within a place?

Regarding the label service - I picked up the above way of doing it from an example I was given - so I'm not totally sure of how it works. Please do tell me how to do \"language fallback for the labels you concanate\". It seems that simply changing FILTER(lang(?p31label)='sv') to FILTER(lang(?p31label)='[AUTO_LANGUAGE],sv') does not work. I'd like the result to be in Swedish, and fallback to anything else if Swedish is not available. @Robertsilen: Here is a version using the label service for the labels. It tries first for a Swedish label, then a Finnish and English label if none is found. Last resort will be the Q-number instead of a label.

 Try it! But all I have are IATA codes, geo coords and country. No continent (blanks). Moreover, I wasn't able to add city to the query as a property.And i receive lots of cases of duplicated IATA code because of different geo coords, for example: ROD Point(19.899918 -33.812355) ROD Point(19.903697222 -33.811775) Is there anyone that can help me obtain the result I need without duplicates?Thank you!--195.32.95.24 13:21, 3 March 2020 (UTC) Continent are blank because there are no values for airport items. continent (P30) are normally only used for countries, and in case of countries in more than one continent also in the largest subdivisions. So you would need to use a chain of located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) values until you found an item giving the continent. It can be a little tricky to do that and only select the correct values for countries in multiple continents. To avoid duplicates of coordinates the results can grouped by IATA code. I don't have time to write code for this now, but can do it later if no one else has done it. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 14:17, 3 March 2020 (UTC) Hi Dipsacus, thank you for your feedback.

First, there isn't data about continent for all places in Wikidata! When a country has parts in more than one continent, the code will try to get the continent from the largest administrative unit that the item is in instead of from the country. But that isn't always possible, so for some airports there will more than one value for continent, even though only one is true. Another problem is that there isn't time enough to handle all 8.745 airports with IATA code on Wikidata. So if you remove the limit on results, you have to also remove either all the code for continent or the code for labels (the SERVICE wikibase:label line) to avoid that the query times out.

For example I get: wd:L224884 independizatu wd:L22370-S1 stát v Evropě And it doesn't make sense, because independizatu (L224884) is not Suède (L22370-S1) and the word isn't a stát v Evropě. -Theklan (talk) 19:53, 4 March 2020 (UTC) @Theklan: Yeah, I think that’s due to the “produce all glosses that exist” I mentioned below (it would also, in reverse, produce the corresponding senses). I thought I had time to write the second part of my response before you’d see the first one, but clearly not, sorry :D --TweetsFactsAndQueries (talk) 20:00, 4 March 2020 (UTC) And as for the too many results, I think I just made a mistake in the query logic and it didn’t surface before because all the results had senses (I think). But if the inner query doesn’t find any senses for a lexeme, and ?sampleSense is unbound for some result, then I think the OPTIONAL in the outer query will produce all glosses that exist. I can’t think of a correct way to fix that, actually (the skos:definition triple needs to move inside the ontolex:sense OPTIONAL block, but then you’d need to do both SAMPLE(?sense) and SAMPLE(?gloss) in the same aggregation, and I think the two might select a sense and gloss that don’t match up), but maybe the sense isn’t actually necessary as a query output, in which case this should work: SELECT ?lexeme (GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT ?lemma; separator = \"/\") AS ?lemmata) (SAMPLE(?gloss) AS ?anyGloss) WHERE {
  SERVICE bd:sample {
    ?lexeme dct:language wd:Q8752.

  }
  ?lexeme wikibase:lemma ?lemma.
  OPTIONAL { ?lexeme ontolex:sense/skos:definition ?gloss. }
}
GROUP BY ?lexeme
 Try it! --TweetsFactsAndQueries (talk) 19:52, 4 March 2020 (UTC) No, wait, I found a solution that gives you the ?sampleSense and corresponding ?anyGloss without exploding the results. It’s a bit hacky, and a lot slower, though, so I don’t recommend it unless you really need both. SELECT ?lexeme (GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT ?lemma; separator = \"/\") AS ?lemmata) ?sampleSense (SAMPLE(?gloss) AS ?anyGloss)

As an example, only 3 of the first 20 items in the \"PetScan query\" result are present in the \"Search query\" result. @Dipsacus fullonum: Do you know the reason for this big discrepancy? --Larske (talk) 09:40, 8 March 2020 (UTC) @Larske: I don't know for sure but the search may have hit the limits of the \"deepcat\" search method in Wikipedia. See en:Help:Searching#deepcategory:. The help page says: \"The depth of the tree is currently limited to 5 levels, and the overall number of categories is limited to 256.\" --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 10:34, 8 March 2020 (UTC) @Dipsacus fullonum: I think there must be some other problem with the deepcat search. The number of categories are just 40, well below 256, and the depth i just 2 levels (excluding the top level), well below 5. And if the limit(s) were hit, I think there should be a warning message on this search result page, but there isn't. I noticed that PetScan misses the 474 articles on the subcategories to Sailors (379 articles i 8 subcategories) and Volleyball players (95 articles in one subcategory). The total number of articles in the category tree is 11,211. --Larske (talk) 14:25, 8 March 2020 (UTC) @Larske: The deepcat search only gives 4.582 results (see https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&limit=5000&offset=0&ns0=1&search=deepcat%3A%22Competitors+at+the+2016+Summer+Olympics%22&advancedSearch-current={}) so the result isn truncated by the MWAPI service.

Pasting into Ordia's text to lexemes is what I have done so far, and I am using Listeria queries a lot for testing such things (example) but here specifically, I was wondering how this could be streamlined and perhaps triggered by some missing page on Scholia, as per this ticket.

It can run on all Zika article that currently exist. It shouldn't be too complicated to invert it (list the words that exist). --- Jura 23:04, 7 March 2020 (UTC) @Jura1: That last query is indeed very close to what I wanted (which is not entirely spelled out above), but it differs in some details, e.g. it does not list the corresponding lexeme's identifier. But this set of queries of yours has inspired me for several days, and as soon as I got the draft query above to work by adding some more OPTIONAL clauses to the problematic part, I started experimenting with incorporating some of your solutions. Thanks again! --Daniel Mietchen (talk) 01:37, 10 March 2020 (UTC) @Daniel Mietchen: I added another query that lists the lexical categories of corresponding lexemes (and one of these lexemes). If no lexeme is found, placeholder (L254535) is used. Maybe this could work for Scholia. I think we still need to find a good way to handle taxon names (see Property talk:P225#IETF tag for values and its parts e.g.). I revised the other queries slightly. --- Jura 13:29, 11 March 2020 (UTC) If it's not available yet, a service that does that on WQS would be good to have. Maybe with a federation query, one could try to do the conversion on another SPARQL server that has a corresponding extension installed (if there is). There are probably a few complicated ways of solving this with existing functions, e.g. count word delimiters, extract each word, combine that .. --- Jura 15:15, 7 March 2020 (UTC)  How many words to check Items used: Zika virus (Q202864)   Properties used: main subject (P921)   , title (P1476)   """@en;
