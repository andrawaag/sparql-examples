 Try it! Elena Ferrante (Q368127) has no name in native language (P1559) statement. Query needs to make ?author wdt:P1559 ?authorlabel. optional (and fix the variable name in filter(lang(?authorlabel) = \"en\")). And, indeed, questionable whether limiting name in native language to EN values would work effectively for IT authors. lang=\"it\" might work a little better.

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 11:44, 2 March 2022 (UTC) Thank you so much! How can I add the name of the author? 137.204.150.19 12:29, 2 March 2022 (UTC) If you're unfamiliar with the WD user interface, maybe take the statements tour. Largely, the answer is, visit the item and add a statement. However for this author there is a question: does a pseudonymous writer name have a name in a native language? --Tagishsimon (talk) 12:55, 2 March 2022 (UTC) How to pass a list of QIDs to a secondary query I have a query as such SELECT ?art ?artLabel ?artDescription ?wdLabel ?ps_Label WITH {

 Try it! In my mental model, %select_art stores a list of QIDs. Say I now have a list of QIDs I'm interested in, say [Q57, Q103, Q149, Q187, Q187, Q187, Q276, Q372, Q373, Q428], can I set that to %select_art?

 Try it! Unfortunately, when a person has multiple values for one of the properties being concatenated--like Ferid Murad--it duplicates the value of the other property. So Murad has \"Americans\" and \"Albanians\" properly displayed but two instances of \"United States of America\". What would be a better way to format my query to prevent this type of duplication?

 Try it! But if I now try to count how many rivers have particular counts of incoming links, I get batshit insane numbers - there's now one instance of a river with 648 incoming links. It doesn't seem to make any difference whether I (COUNT(?count_linked_items) ... or (COUNT(?river) ... or (COUNT(DISTINCT ?river) ..., which gives you further insight into my frail grip on aggregation.
