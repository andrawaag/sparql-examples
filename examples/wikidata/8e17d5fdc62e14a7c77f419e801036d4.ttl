My understanding is that manual exclusion from the query is my only option—is this correct? If so, what's the best way to write this such that it's easy to maintain a list of QIDs to exclude from a series of queries? MINUS or NOT EXISTS? When I edit the list of QIDs, is there a way to host the list in one location or would I need to update it in each query? czar 05:58, 1 January 2020 (UTC) I figured it out with MINUS[1] but do {{Ping}} me if you have any suggestions for improvement czar 07:27, 1 January 2020 (UTC) @Czar: There's also NOT IN, which is deployed within FILTER, in the form filter (?item NOT IN (wd:Q516882,wd:Q12345)). I suspect this might be the easiest approach. --Tagishsimon (talk) 14:03, 1 January 2020 (UTC) Edits made by a user Hi all,I don't know if this request is possible or not: I would like to have the list of items (subclasses of structure of worship (Q1370598) in France (Q142)) for which the user Peter17-Bot add the property coordinate location (P625) (e.g. https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q38434124&diff=615373953&oldid=551868164). Thank you very much. Tubezlob (🙋) 11:29, 27 December 2019 (UTC) @Tubezlob: AFAIK, not via SPARQL. Quarry probably can - here's a not very dissimilar query - https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/16335 - presuming that Quarry can filter on the edit summary. (iirc, Quarry cannot see the content of edits, but can see edit metadata.) Sadly successful Quarrying continues to be beyond my paygrade. --Tagishsimon (talk) 06:03, 28 December 2019 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: Thank you, that's a good hint! Is there an expert of Quarry here? 😊 Tubezlob (🙋) 09:01, 28 December 2019 (UTC) If the edits happend in a relatively short period, I would try SPARQL. Have a look at Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries/examples/advanced#Map_of_newspapers_in_the_United_States_by_presence_of_Infobox_newspaper_in_their_English_Wikipedia_article. I would combine: Regular SPARQL query to get the instance/subclass of structure of worship (Q1370598) in France (Q142) Mediawiki API request to get all the edits of the bot in a certain period. Multichill (talk) 12:48, 2 January 2020 (UTC) @Multichill: Thank you for your answer! I made this SPARQL query: SELECT ?church ?churchLabel ?location
WHERE
{
  ?church wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q1370598; 
         wdt:P17 wd:Q142;
         wdt:P625 ?location.
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"fr\". }
}
 Try it! For the Mediawiki API, I tried this request (URL): {
	\"action\": \"query\",
	\"format\": \"json\",
	\"list\": \"usercontribs\",
	\"uclimit\": \"max\",
	\"ucstart\": \"2017-12-30T15:00:00.000Z\",
	\"ucend\": \"2017-12-31T15:00:00.000Z\",
	\"ucuser\": \"Peter17-Bot\"
} But I don't get anything. I don't understand how Mediawiki API works (I have no knowledge at all about APIs). How can I have just the list of QIDs? Also, I saw that this query is limited to 500 results. Is it possible to get directly the ≈ 7,500 results?Thank you very much, Tubezlob (🙋) 16:23, 2 January 2020 (UTC) I consulted the manual at mw:Wikidata_Query_Service/User_Manual/MWAPI#Supported_services and it only supports so called generators. That's possible for search, but not for usercontributions I'm afraid. Getting this data will involve some better trickery. Multichill (talk) 17:19, 2 January 2020 (UTC) @Multichill: Thank you. So I did the work manually: I copied the modifs summaries obtained with https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&target=Peter17-Bot (≈ 15 pages of 500 edits) between 2017-12-30 16:31 and 2017-12-31 14:09 and did a regex search to get the QIDs. It was not so long and it works! Tubezlob (🙋) 18:29, 2 January 2020 (UTC) Adding labels to aggregated values I wanted to know the most common occupations of people with biographies at dawiki, and wrote this query: # Count biographies at dawiki by occupation 
SELECT ?job ?jobLabel (COUNT(?link) AS ?count)

  ?person wdt:P106 ?job.

 Try it! The query times out. However it runs fine if I remove \"?jobLabel\" from SELECT and GROUP BY: # Count biographies at dawiki by occupation

}
GROUP BY ?job
ORDER BY DESC(?count)

 Try it! It cannot take long to find 10 labels after the counting is done, so can the query be rewritten to include the labels more efficiently? --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 14:17, 2 January 2020 (UTC) @Dipsacus fullonum: Named subqueries are your friend. # Count biographies at dawiki by occupation

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 14:51, 2 January 2020 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: Thank you very much. I also want to know the distribution of sexes for each occupation. I found a method defining variables ?male og ?female as either 0 or 1 and then making sums of these variables for each occupation: # Count biographies at dawiki by occupation and sex
SELECT ?job ?jobLabel ?m ?f ?count with {

 Try it! It works, but it seems a little weird to use sums. I wonder if there is a more direct and faster way to do this. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 16:34, 2 January 2020 (UTC) Url and date Hello.

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 14:08, 1 January 2020 (UTC) @Tagishsimon:, there seems to be something wrong? I've already found several items that already contains an archive URL (P1065) qualifier. --Trade (talk) 01:03, 2 January 2020 (UTC) @Trade: Could you point me at one; might help in figuring out the error. --Tagishsimon (talk) 01:18, 2 January 2020 (UTC) @Tagishsimon:, Mange mennesker dræbt i skyderier i moskeer (Q62071687) --Trade (talk) 09:59, 2 January 2020 (UTC) @Trade: The problem here is that for 200 objects, the one you give as an exampel is one of them, the archive URL (P1065) is given as a qualifier instead of a reference in the full work available at URL (P953) claim. Only 15 objects use archive URL (P1065) as a reference. If you want to exclude both types, try the following query, but I really think there is some cleaning up to be done for those objects that use archive URL (P1065) in an incorrect way. I am not sure which way is the correct, but the different uses are really confusing. SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?P953

 Try it! --Larske (talk) 11:28, 2 January 2020 (UTC) New year's resolution is to read the question properly; Trade pointed to qualifiers. My response (and I was probably thinking of Xaris33's preceding question) dealt with references. --Tagishsimon (talk) 12:26, 2 January 2020 (UTC) @Larske:, most of the incorrect uses were made a long time ago by a few users so correcting them should not be a problem. The way i understand there are two ways to use archive url: Either as a qualifier for full work available at URL (P953), official website (P856) and withdrawn identifier value (Q21441764). Or as a property for references. --Trade (talk) 15:29, 3 January 2020 (UTC) Sitelinks for multiple items At https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Wikidata:Project_chat&oldid=1083113466#3_conflicted_categories_should_probably_be_reduced_to_2 it was suggested that three items should be made into two because of overlap in content on some wikis. I thought I could use the query service for a list of sitelinks which existed for all three. I used a query for URLs of items, but couldn't see a way to make a list of sites for each item or how many of these items existed on each site, so I used another query for a list of sites and their URLs, and copied the results into a spreadsheet to obtain the answer. Can this be achieved with SPARQL? Peter James (talk) 13:15, 25 December 2019 (UTC) @Peter James: Not sure if I understand what you expect.

    bd:serviceParam wikibase:api \"EntitySearch\";
                    wikibase:endpoint \"www.wikidata.org\";

    ?item wikibase:apiOutputItem mwapi:item .
    ?ordinal wikibase:apiOrdinal true .

  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }
} ORDER BY ASC (?ordinal) LIMIT 100
 Try it! I'm using the EntitySearch service so that I can get the :apiOrdinal value to help sort the results for relevance, and ?type contains the whole list of parent types so that I can just use \"creative work\" and \"sports team\" as catch-alls to filter on. (The FILTER list of Q types is incomplete, I was just starting to get the test going)But, the problem happens when you replace \"Patriots\" with \"Fellowship\". In theory I should get the book and film Fellowship of the Ring. But the only result is for the \"group\" Fellowship of the Ring. If you take off the FILTER, you'll see it only returns 40 records from the EntitySearch for some reason? And if you change it to \"Fellowship of the Ring\" it will correctly find the book and film, so the EntitySearch can find those two. But for some reason it seems like EntitySearch is capping the results to a limit of 40?Any ideas on what's going on? Or an alternative to do this search differently, preferably still with the :apiOrdinal so that the results are sorted by relevance?Thanks! – The preceding unsigned comment was added by Thomas.lumen (talk • contribs) at 17:16‎, 6. 7. 2019 (UTC).Stale request.

I tweaked it a bit and the report got an update, but it is still close to the timeout limit. —MisterSynergy (talk) 19:47, 14 January 2020 (UTC) Is there something we can do to prevent the timeout? --RAN (talk) 01:20, 15 January 2020 (UTC) Not really. Internally the query processes almost 2 million items from which it filters the few problematic ones. With the current timeout limit of 60 seconds it will always be a challenge to get this done in time, no matter which tweak we use to make the query more efficient. —MisterSynergy (talk) 07:38, 15 January 2020 (UTC) @MisterSynergy: How about if we modify the query to only look at new entries and entries that have been modified since it was last run? I corrected the about 1K historical errors, so we should only have errors in new entries, and where people add errors on purpose, or where bots conflate people with similar names and add in a nonsensical additional birth or death date. RAN (talk) 00:40, 17 January 2020 (UTC) Unfortunately we cannot query following that strategy, as WDQS has basically no access to item histories; it only sees the status quo of an item. The only way is to collect all ~2M items that have P569 and P570 and P31:Q5 and then filter those few which are probably incorrect. —MisterSynergy (talk) 00:49, 17 January 2020 (UTC) all items with P536 or P597 and not P4544 Hi!

 Try it! because of the fact that Treccani's Enciclopedia Italiana ID (P4223) has often more than one value, I would appreciate very much the possibility of making each person appear only in one line, with different eiUrls grouped in one cell, separated each other by \", \".

I want to find all items that have country (P17)->Cyprus (Q229) and a value with instance of (P31) and that value (that item) must have instance of (P31)->dam (Q12323).For example, Germasogeia Dam (Q22985821) is not in the list you create. Germasogeia Dam (Q22985821) -> instance of (P31) -> earth-fill dam (Q47499777) and earth-fill dam (Q47499777) -> instance of (P31) -> dam (Q12323) Dipotamos Dam (Q62619235) -> instance of (P31) -> rock-fill dam (Q11350418) and rock-fill dam (Q11350418) -> instance of (P31) -> dam (Q12323) Both Germasogeia Dam (Q22985821) and Dipotamos Dam (Q62619235) must be in the list for example.

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 12:28, 17 January 2020 (UTC)  @Xaris333, Tagishsimon: Just a comment. The modified query will give you the result you asked for, but not because earth-fill dam (Q47499777) is instance of (P31) dam (Q12323). You get it because earth-fill dam (Q47499777) is subclass of (P279) embankment dam (Q1244922) which is subclass of (P279) dam (Q12323). Same goes for rock-fill dam (Q11350418). I think it is \"structurally wrong\" to set earth-fill dam (Q47499777) and rock-fill dam (Q11350418) as instance of (P31) dam (Q12323) as they both represent types/classes of dams and not instances/individuals of dams. Also dome dam (Q56631985) and arch-gravity dam (Q357679), representing other types of dams, have incorrectly been given the property instance of (P31). --Larske (talk) 15:04, 17 January 2020 (UTC) I agree. How can we add the information what type of dam is according to the structure or material? Please read w:en:Dam#Types of dams. Xaris333 (talk) 10:07, 18 January 2020 (UTC) If you want to introduce a \"dam by material\" class object which is subclass of (P279) dam (Q12323), you can do it similar to bridge by material (Q17645478), where you have both wooden bridge (Q428759) and metal bridge (Q3397572) being subclass of (P279) bridge by material (Q17645478) and steel bridge (Q12042110) is a subclass of (P279) metal bridge (Q3397572). Another way, if you don't want to introduce more subclasses is to use the property made from material (P186) for the individual dam objects. Both ways are possible but the SPARQL question you need to select e.g. all \"steel dams\" are different: In the first case you ask for ?dam wdt:P31 wd:\"steel dam\" . (where \"steel dam\" is the new class object) You also have to change the P31 property for all individual \"steel dams\" from the more generic dam (Q12323) to the more specific new class object \"steel dam\". In the other case you ask for ?dam wdt:P31/P279* wd:Q12323; wdt:P186 wd:Q11427 . You also have to make sure that all individual \"steel dams\" have the made from material (P186) property set to steel (Q11427). If there are several individual \"steel dams\", I think the first of these two alternatives is the better one. --Larske (talk) 10:49, 18 January 2020 (UTC) Don't make a new item for steel dam as there already is steel dam (Q16904906). --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 13:26, 20 January 2020 (UTC) Feature arcticle Hello.
