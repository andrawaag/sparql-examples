Now I try to implement this also for urban area in Sweden (Q12813115). The problem here is that the valid dates are not always December 31. 1960-75 it was November 1 and in 1980 it was September 15. Is it possible to modify the \"wrong startdate\"-code to handle this? -- Innocent bystander (talk) 15:04, 2 January 2017 (UTC) @Pasleim: You maybe not noticed this, or you are maybe busy?! That's ok, but anybody can feel free to answer me. Valid startdates are December 31 some years, November 1 some years, and September 15 in 1980. Could this be solved? Ideally, no other dates should be used, but sometimes we make mistakes. It is those cases I am looking for! -- Innocent bystander (talk) 14:56, 3 January 2017 (UTC) In that case it's probably the easiest just to list all allowed dates explicitly: SELECT ?item ?startdate ?date WHERE{

 Try it! --Pasleim (talk) 09:36, 4 January 2017 (UTC) Calendar dates in order It would be nice to be able to use Wikidata generate calendars of scientists' birthdays, of discoveries, and so on. I'm thinking in particular of outreach to museums, libraries and similar institutions that run public events over a long period. A starting point for such a calendar is a list of dates in order. My attempt is at User:MartinPoulter/queries#Attempt_at_a_calendar_ordering_of_days_of_the_year:_breaks_down_pretty_quickly - not exactly a complete success. Is there an elegant solution? MartinPoulter (talk) 12:13, 5 January 2017 (UTC) Something like this, perhaps? SELECT ?date ?dateLabel ?monthNumber ?dayNumber WHERE {
  # a date item is a “determinator for date of periodic occurrence” and part of a month
  ?date wdt:P31 wd:Q14795564;
        wdt:P361 ?month.
  # a month is a month of the Gregorian calendar and has a month number
  ?month wdt:P279 wd:Q18602249;
         wdt:P2837 ?monthNumber.
  # February 30 and “first saturday in March” …
  FILTER(?date NOT IN (wd:Q37096, wd:Q21130129)).
  # and here it gets ugly, it seems there’s no way to get the date’s day except from the label
  ?date rdfs:label ?dateLabel. FILTER(LANG(?dateLabel) = \"en\").
  ?month rdfs:label ?monthLabel. FILTER(LANG(?monthLabel) = \"en\").
  FILTER(STRSTARTS(?dateLabel, CONCAT(?monthLabel, \" \"@en))). # sanity check
  BIND(xsd:integer(SUBSTR(?dateLabel, STRLEN(?monthLabel)+1)) AS ?dayNumber).
}
ORDER BY ?monthNumber ?dayNumber
 Try it! It parses the label to get the day number, which is pretty icky… I suppose that should be stored on the item somewhere (series ordinal qualifier on the part of statement?), does someone want to do a quick bot run? :) --TweetsFactsAndQueries (talk) 18:31, 5 January 2017 (UTC) Thanks so much, User:TweetsFactsAndQueries. This is exactly what I was hoping for and I look forward to making some interesting calendars with it. MartinPoulter (talk) 15:34, 6 January 2017 (UTC) People that held position Q28128358 I'm trying go generate a Listeria list for people that held this position Q28128358. I would like for the list to have item number, article name, the start and end date for when the person held this position and an image. So far only Tom Forssner (Q5737866) has this position stated, but more to come. Is there something else needed in order to generate this query? //Mippzon (talk) 23:06, 5 January 2017 (UTC) Maybe this works for you. --- Jura 06:20, 6 January 2017 (UTC) Thanks! Just was I was looking for and more! I only needed to replace the position with the one I was interested in. Thanks! //Mippzon (talk) 10:32, 6 January 2017 (UTC) Querying most important scientists Hi. I'm looking to construct a query that returns a table that I can download as a csv file and ultimately import into a popular flashcard program (Anki) for study. Specifically, I'd like to construct a query that returns a list of scientists along with an image link and a number of key details about their lives such as date of birth, date of death, place of birth, place of death, spouse (if any), prominent occupation(s), country affiliation, and so on. I will list the properties I'm interested in below. Secondly, I'd like this list to be ordered according to some heuristic (such as rewards received or how many different languages the person has an article in) that measures/approximates a scientist's relevancy or importance, and then limit the list to, say, the top 500 \"most important\" scientists.I tried constructing my own query but I ran into several problems and I'm too new to SPARQL and wikidata to know how to fix or work around them quickly.One problem I noticed is that not all scientists are classed as such (e.g. scientist is not listed as one of Isaac Newton's occupations). According to one set of queries I did there are some 9630ish physicists on wikidata but only 2830ish scientists. Is there a way to work around this easily? If not then I can use separate queries for each occupation I am interested in.Another problem I was having is determining a good heuristic for estimating the importance of each person. Ultimately something like (unique) page views on wikipedia would be optimal, but as far as I know you can't get that data through a query. I'm not very familiar with what all you can get through wikidata yet. Ideas on how to best determine importance with the information that's on wikidata would be very welcome.Another thing I would like (to know how) to do is concatenate values into one cell on the table, especially when a property is associated with more than one value. Right now when I run a query and a scientist has, say, two date born values then a table with two rows for that scientist will be returned, each with the distinct dates born. I would like to do something like concatenate these values or simply select the first one.I would also like (to know how) to filter the results by death year (e.g. only return scientists that died after 1600 and before 1940).Finally, I would like to know if there's a way to download all at once the linked images or other media files that a query may return. I need these, in addition to the csv, in order to construct a flashcard deck in Anki that contains images or other media. Right now I'm expecting that I'll have to write a little python script to scrape the images off wikimedia, but it would be the bee's knees if there was a way to download all the media without doing that (and without doing it manually, either).As for the key details I mentioned above, I'm interested in most of the basic information that would appear on a person's infobox on Wikipedia. Specifically: 0. Name 1. An image 2. Description (the one in the box at the top of a person's page on wikidata) 3. Place of birth 4. Place of death (optional; to include scientists that have not died) 5. Date of birth 6. Date of death (optional) 7. Nationality or country/ies of citizenship 8. Gender 9. Spouse Name (optional) 10. Educated at (optional) 11. Taught at (optional) 12. Awards received (optional) 13. Magnum opus (optional)I would be very grateful to anyone who can either construct the query for me or would help me traverse the learning curve in constructing my own query. To get all scientist you can query for all items with claim occupation (P106)=scientist (Q901) or subclasses of scientist (Q901). This can be achieved by ?item wdt:P106/wdt:P279* wd:Q901 .
 We can't query for page views. Only data which is entered here by users is queryable. A possible heuristic for estimating the importance of a person is the number of sitelinks to Wikipedia and sister projects. That number you can get by ?item wikibase:sitelinks ?cnt .
 So a good starting point for you could be SELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE{
  ?item wdt:P106/wdt:P279* wd:Q901;
        wikibase:sitelinks ?cnt        
} ORDER BY DESC(?cnt) LIMIT 500
 Try it! or with labels SELECT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE{

    SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?cnt WHERE{
      ?item wdt:P106/wdt:P279* wd:Q901;

 Try it! --Pasleim (talk) 09:33, 30 December 2016 (UTC) Cool. I didn't know you could query for links to wikipedia. That should work well enough. I'm still running up against the 'scientist' category not including certain individuals and also including individuals that I don't want (such as Ezra Pound). I think I'm going to simply work around by performing a bunch of queries using categories like 'physicist', 'chemist', and 'geologist' instead. Moving on to the next problem of concatenating values. I have this code: SELECT ?person ?personLabel (GROUP_CONCAT(?nationality;separator=', ') AS ?nationalities) WHERE{
  { 
    SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?cnt ?nationality WHERE{
      ?person wdt:P106/wdt:P279* wd:Q901;
            wikibase:sitelinks ?cnt .  
      ?person wdt:P27 ?nationality .
    } ORDER BY DESC(?cnt) LIMIT 500
  }
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\" }        
} 
GROUP BY ?person ?personLabel
ORDER BY DESC(?cnt)
 Try it! The problem is that group_concat turns the entity into a url string. When I change ?nationality in the group_concat statement into ?nationalityLabel nothing shows up in the table. How does one turn the entity into its label string before putting it into the group_concat statement? Edit: Oh and another thing I was wondering about: is there a way to simply select just the first value of a property? For instance Joseph Priestley has two values for his country of citizenship property: the United Kingdom and the United States. Is there a way to select just the first one (in this case the United Kingdom)? --The Magical Septicorn 19:42, 30 December 2016 (UTC) I have found the solution to this problem: SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?personDescription

I think you may be interested in the following. We have an API that you can call to get recommendation on what article to create next by providing a source and destination language (if you are translating) and a keyword (if you want to focus on a specific topic). In a high level, what we do is that we get the source and destination languages from you, find all articles that exist in source but are missing in destination, use your keyword to find similar articles to the keyword you have provided, and then use pageviews in the source language to give you recommendations on what to edit next. You can check out an example of it at https://recommend.wmflabs.org/types/translation/v1/articles?source=en&target=de&seed=Apple (based on morelike search) and https://recommend.wmflabs.org/types/translation/v1/articles?source=en&target=de&seed=Apple&search=related_articles (based on relatedarticles search). You are also welcome to use the experimental tool we have for this service: https://recommend.wmflabs.org/ . The research that supports this work is published at https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03235 if you are curious about the details of it. And, if there is any question I can respond, please ping. --LZia (WMF) (talk) 22:21, 8 February 2017 (UTC) Thanks for your recommendations LZia (WMF). My main motivation towards asking for this code was because I had decided to make 1 article from each nation in the world. So I felt that in selecting the article to write from each nation, I should probably go with a well written article in an another language, as it would make my work easier. While I like the https://recommend.wmflabs.org/ experimental tool, this is probably not what I wanted as well. Mduvekot did a good job in providing me with what I had asked for, even though I feel that is not really helpful when it comes to making decisions as well. So if either of you can provide me with something that would help me choose what to write from each country - ideally an important article from another wiki that is missing in the English Wiki (and with pictures - an important reason why I asked for FA in other languages as they tend to have pictures), that would be really helpful. What are the birds taxa with no authors provided? (example) Hello all, I have been trying by myself but did not succed. Could someone create a request for having a list of taxons with missing authors, so that I can fill some of them? I would like: instance of (P31) to be taxon (Q16521) taxon name (P225) to have no qualifier taxon author (P405) or no qualifier year of publication of scientific name for taxon (P574) it would be even better if I could choose the taxonomic group to investigate, but as the classificaton is recursive (through parent taxon (P171)) I am not sure it is easily feasible.

Totodu74 (talk) 22:35, 7 January 2017 (UTC) @Totodu74: It may be possibe to import some of this data from Wikispecies. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 23:05, 7 January 2017 (UTC) Yes, we could import a lot from Wikispecies, as well as from the French Wikipedia (on which we tried for years to always provide first names for authors, like [[Example Author|Author]], [[1864]] in the taxobox), and especially on some groups (herptiles, arachnids) this is very well done. Furthermore, nominal subspecies could inherit author citation from their parent (e.g. Sitta nagaensis nagaensis (Q27629808) from Chestnut-vented Nuthatch (Q902434)). However, I am totally unable to develop any script to do so! :D Totodu74 (talk) 23:16, 7 January 2017 (UTC) A Christmassy request Hoi, is there a way to query the kings that existed east of Bethlehem who lived in the year 0CE ?

 Try it! There are certainly better approaches but this is how far my skills have gone so far. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 14:21, 13 January 2017 (UTC) Items without labels in French Hi all,Wikidata no labels and Names as labels don't work anymore (apparently because Wikidata Query Service is closed). These tools was very useful for me. It's possible to have the same result (items-ID and labels in the source language) with a SPARQL queries?My example: instance of (P31)fourth-level administrative division in Indonesia (Q2225692) . Without label in French, labels source: Indonesian.Thank you, Tubezlob (🙋) 12:53, 14 January 2017 (UTC) My version: SELECT ?item ?label_id WHERE {
  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q2225692 .
  ?item rdfs:label ?label_id filter(lang(?label_id) = \"id\") .
  MINUS { ?item rdfs:label ?label_fr filter(lang(?label_fr) = \"fr\") . }
}
LIMIT 1000

It's totally what I wanted! 👍 Tubezlob (🙋) 13:15, 14 January 2017 (UTC) Constraint with an complicated exception Would it be possible to modify the P1448-constraint for P776, so that those who have \"P31:minor locality in Sweden (Q14839548) startdate:2015-12-31\" have an automatic exception from this constraint?
