Optionally, the same object has a \"hypothetical protein\" alias which should be moved to descriptions (and do the same to all proteins with that alias), and as third option remove the \"Listeria gene\" alias which is completely nonsensical (proteins with an alias of form taxon+\"gene\" would be the general target).
