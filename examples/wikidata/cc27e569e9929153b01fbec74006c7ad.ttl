MargaretRDonald (talk) 09:20, 1 November 2020 (UTC) Weird time-out in a query Here's a query that is giving me weird time-outs, and I don't understand why, given that with very small changes I can make it not time out (but also not give me the results I want). The query is work-in-progress, towards plotting how Scottish church ministers moved from one job to another. The key thing I'm trying to get here are the coordinates on each line for their previous job, and the coordinates for their current job; so that I then would be able to plot a line between them.The code below times out.But weirdly, if I comment out the lines giving me ?form_lat and ?from_lon then everything works (tinyurl.com/yxbhcm37) though of course I don't get the 'from' coords. Interestingly, it is not the line ?from p:P625 ?from_coords_stmt which seems to cause a problem, but rather any subsequent use of ?from_coords_stmt, eg even ?from_coords_stmt ps:P625 ?from_coords (tinyurl.com/yxgjyoue ; cf also tinyurl.com/y2kz9uts). I don't understand this.Also, if I remove the OPTIONAL from the join in the %ministers_moves block, then the problem goes away. tinyurl.com/yy54r62r (But then I don't get a line in the output for the minister's first job). For the ministers' first jobs, with the OPTIONAL, the COALESCE should give ?from the same value as ?place. And the query can find the coordinates for ?place with no problem. So why is it failing for ?from ?This kind of time-out is the sort of thing that could happen from a typo, if the typo led to a line with a triple with unbound variables. But I don't think I've made a typo, or got unbound variables that I can see. Can anybody spot or explain what might be going on here? Jheald (talk) 19:56, 31 October 2020 (UTC)Query: SELECT DISTINCT

With a little bit of work I had the code of looking up the airport from its ICAO code working.(https://w.wiki/jxo) However I am having difficulties trying to get the city where the airport is located.located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) looks promising, but a few attempts reveals that it would not only return the city of the airport, but also the province, the state, the municipality, etc. For example, RJAA (Narita International Airport near Tokyo, Japan) has both Narita (the city) and Chiba Perfecture listed there, KUNV (University Park Airport in State College, Pennsylvania, USA) only has Pensylvania listed, and ZSQD (Qingdao Liuting International Airport in Qingdao, Shandong, China) only has Chengyang District (one level lower than city) listed.I came with two solutions but failed to put the codes together.The first solution is to keep using the wdt:P131 and set up a filter to remove anything that is not a city. SELECT ?airport ?airportLabel ?airportIn ?airportInLabel ?airportInType ?airportInTypeLabel WHERE {
  ?airport wdt:P239 \"RJAA\".
  { ?airport wdt:P131 ?airportIn. }
  { ?airportIn wdt:P31 ?airportInType. }
  FILTER(EXISTS { ?airportInType wdt:P279 wd:Q515. })
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }
}
 Try it! It only works with RJAA as it has Narita P31 Q494721 (instance of City of Japan) and Q494721 P279 Q515 (subclass of City). It did not work with ZGGG which has Guangzhou P31 Q515 (instance of City), nor did it work with those airports that only has P131 with districts. Of course I can also manually add those instance of cities into each airport's wikidata entry but that is likely going to take a lot of effort and introduce some redundant info (such as RJAA wdt:P131 Narita wdt:P31 ((city of Japan) AND (city))).The second solution is to take the coordinate of the airport and to do a query to find out which city this coordinate belongs to. I am afraid that it may take way too much resources and I have no idea about how to write a query for such.Please let me know if you have any other thoughts on how I can build a query that takes an ICAO airport code and returns the city the airport is located at.Staph aureus (talk) 17:52, 3 November 2020 (UTC) It really depends what you are looking for. Maybe place served by transport hub (P931) suits you better? If there are multiple values, query the closest or the most populous one. --- Jura 18:18, 3 November 2020 (UTC) Before I may be able to help, I need to know what you mean by \"City of the Airport\". I live in Denmark and none of the Danish airports that I know of are located in a city, but somewhere in the country outside any city. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 21:34, 3 November 2020 (UTC) To make things simpler, I am assuming that every airport, as a building, has its address, and every address has a component of \"City\" or its local equivalent. That is what I am looking for. For Kansai International Airport, I am happy to take Izumisano city instead of the nearby Osaka city. For Vancouver International Airport, I am also happy to take Richmond instead of Vancouver. However if this is more difficult than taking the \"largest city nearby\" then I think I can accept either one. --Staph aureus (talk) 23:45, 3 November 2020 (UTC) Actually Jura's idea of using place served by transport hub (P931) is quite brilliant. Could not believe I missed out such a good property when I was staring at those airports. SELECT ?airport ?airportLabel ?airportIn ?airportInLabel WHERE {
  ?airport wdt:P239 \"RJAA\".
  { ?airport wdt:P931 ?airportIn. }
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }
}
 Try it! It works like a charm now. Thanks for your help. --Staph aureus (talk) 00:00, 4 November 2020 (UTC) @Staph aureus: named after (P138) could be another option. I added a quite a few some time ago (adding more precise P131 seemed less interesting to me). If it's a place, it's usually similar to place served by transport hub (P931) or the other place you were looking for. Querying the distance between these finds a few exceptions. --- Jura 07:22, 4 November 2020 (UTC) Is it possible to list people with items created in the last 12 months? #Mujeres mexicanas

} Try it!The above gives you an idea when they were created. However, it could be that P27=Q96 was added only later.Q88888888 was created at the end of March, so anything more recent would be new since. --- Jura 21:04, 3 November 2020 (UTC) A relative simple approach is find an item created on the limit date. Remove the \"Q\" from the item names and convert the number part to integers. Any items with greater integers than the item from the limit date are created later than that. It is also possible to get the exact creation time for any item with a precision of 1 second by using a MWAPI call but it is limited how many items you can query about in one query without causing timeout. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 21:48, 3 November 2020 (UTC) I would agree that the easiest solution here is to use the QID as a proxy for age, with any ID past your cut-off being new. There may be a few weird cases where an item was created before, a duplicate was created after, and the old item was merged into the new one - but this situation is very unusual. Andrew Gray (talk) 22:52, 3 November 2020 (UTC) @Hispano76: So for example if you only want items created later than Q88000000 from 19 Mar 2020 insert this filter in your code: FILTER (xsd:integer(SUBSTR(STR(?item),33)) > 88000000)
 You can adjust the number as you like to get the right cut off date. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 07:57, 4 November 2020 (UTC) gsbbox equivalent Hi.

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 21:06, 2 November 2020 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: A little tip for another time. You can extract ?item directly from the MWAPI service by using the predicate wikibase:apiOutputItem that automatically converts the title to an IRI for an item. That will make query many times faster. Instead of the normally expensive REGEX function you can also use the simpler FILTER STRENDS(?itemLabel, \"Ruth\") but I doubt it will very noticeable in this case. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 06:59, 3 November 2020 (UTC) Isn't regex usually quicker than the less technical functions (strends, strstarts, ..)? --- Jura 07:18, 3 November 2020 (UTC) That depends on how they are implemented. If STRENDS and STRSTARTS for instance just are wrappers for REGEX, you are right. But they will always be faster if you write a specialized optimized implementation for them. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 07:40, 3 November 2020 (UTC) Well, at Wikidata Query Service. --- Jura 08:50, 3 November 2020 (UTC) Depending on whether you want to include or exclude Del Ruth (Q93133323) or other surnames, you might want to filter just for FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?item wdt:P734 [] }. --- Jura 07:16, 3 November 2020 (UTC) I fixed a few that used \"Ruth\" instead of \"Del Ruth\" or \"van Ruth\". --- Jura 08:50, 3 November 2020 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: how will you tell from your query which person has surname Ruth and which has given name Ruth? --Infovarius (talk) 20:51, 4 November 2020 (UTC) Modify a query to cast the same globe Hello, I'd like to modify this query so that the given item (Q867556 in this example)'s globe should also be used to filter anything that is in a 10-km radius around the point of Q867556, in the same globe.

 Try it! – The preceding unsigned comment was added by Bouzinac (talk • contribs). \"geoGlobe\" should be \"globe\", but I'm not sure if that works well with wikibase:radius though. BTW We are trying to improve the situation for non-Earth coordinates currently mixed into P625, see Wikidata:Property_proposal/planetary_coordinates. --- Jura 08:57, 4 November 2020 (UTC) @Bouzinac: The geospatial search gives an error message if the globe parameter isn't a constant. So it will be necessary to first make one query to get the globe, and then make another query with the found globe inserted as a constant. If a bound variable was possible you could use this query: SELECT ?globe ?place
WHERE
{
  wd:Q867556 p:P625 ?locstatement .

 Try it! But it fails with java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Non-constant globe value is not supported yet.

I already made a query of these battles and sieges here... https://w.wiki/bZRWikipedia infoboxes are showing for these for some battles.

I want:a) a query with all items that have given name (P735) -> a value that have writing system (P282) -> Greek alphabet (Q8216), but they don't have name in native language (P1559). For example, Nikolas Englezou (Q7036597) has given name (P735) -> Nikolas (Q97619413) which is an item that have writing system (P282) -> Greek alphabet (Q8216). Nikolas Englezou (Q7036597) has no name in native language (P1559) (in any language) so it must be in the results.b) a query with all items that have given name (P735) -> a value that have writing system (P282) -> Greek alphabet (Q8216), and they have name in native language (P1559) in a language different that Greek. (for example they may have only one value with P1559 in English, or they may have two values with P1559: one in English and one in Greek). For example, Nikitas Tsakiroglou (Q12881733) has given name (P735) -> Nikitas (Q39292409) which is an item that have writing system (P282) -> Greek alphabet (Q8216). Nikitas Tsakiroglou (Q12881733) has name in native language (P1559) in a language that is not Greek.

However it give more results, mostly Puerto Ricans because Puerto Rico (Q1183) has country (P17) but not located in the administrative territorial entity (P131). Why the 1776 filter? Didn't the inhabitants in the original 13 states become US citizens even if they were born before that date. And the other US states joined USA later anyway. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 02:44, 5 November 2020 (UTC) The filter was to avoid persons died before 1776. But actually, the threshold should be 1868 due to the en:Citizenship Clause. Steak (talk) 08:19, 5 November 2020 (UTC) That makes more sense. The use of date of birth (P569) should be then be changed to date of death (P570), and the variable name also changed. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 09:00, 5 November 2020 (UTC) Missing articles in English Hello,I'm wondering: what are the French-speaking Wikipedia articles with most interwikis... but not in English?

 Try it! It is faster to use an integer constant as object in the triple with wikibase:sitelinks as here, instead of using a variable and a filter. You can run the query repeatedly with decreasing constant values. The space between the number and the period is important here. Without the space, the number would be interpreted as a decimal number instead of an integer, and nothing would be found. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 07:42, 6 November 2020 (UTC) I found the next results after 60 at items with 50, 47, 45, 43, 37, 35, 34, 33 sitelinks. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 08:00, 6 November 2020 (UTC) Checking where entities are referredIs there a better way to answer the question \"Does this show up anywhere but as a statement qualifier?\" than the querySELECT ?sub ?uri WHERE {

  FILTER ( !regex(?uri, '/entity/statement/') )

 Try it! Can I test that ?sub is a statement without parsing the url? Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 11:27, 6 November 2020 (UTC) If I understand your request correctly, you want to have items with statements that have any qualifier with Hawaii (Q58425066) as the qualifier value. This is the query: SELECT ?item ?p ?qualifier WHERE {
  ?item ?p [ ?pq wd:Q58425066 ] .
  ?qualifier wikibase:qualifier ?pq .
}
 Try it! —MisterSynergy (talk) 12:22, 6 November 2020 (UTC) Sort of. My question began by wondering where any of the United States senate constituency (Q58425000) items were referred to. The result of the simple query seemed to be returning all statements qualifiers, but I was wondering if it was the object of any statements and so wanted to filter out results where the subject is a statement. Does this make sense? It looks like your query looks specifically for places where this entity is a qualifier. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 13:03, 6 November 2020 (UTC) I still don't really get it. Maybe for the moment have a look at DESCRIBE wd:Q58425066
 Try it! . This lists all triples where the item in question is involved as subject or object; some of them are rather technical, but it does contain all links from and to that item. In general, most backlinks to an item should have any of these prefixes: wdt: (main statement value, direct link from subject item), ps: (main statement value, via statement node), pq: (qualifier value, via statement node), or pr: (reference value, via reference node that is connected to the statement node via prov:wasDerivedFrom). Technically, there are a few other places (predicates) where items could theoretically be used as values, but it is very unlikely that you find any of those when dealing with election constituencies. —MisterSynergy (talk) 13:20, 6 November 2020 (UTC) This looks like it helps to answer my original question, though I'd like to do it for all instances of United States senate constituency (Q58425000). I guess my solution isn't awful, but I was more or less looking to check does ?sub have a specified prefix. FWIW, per my proposal on Wikidata:Project_chat I am planning to change the labels on such entries to add the word \"delegation\". I wanted to make sure I understood all uses of them before making such a change. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 13:29, 6 November 2020 (UTC) Okay now I see, I guess. The \"prefix check\" is indeed only possible as a string-based operation, which is rather inefficient. Optimally we'd have something like ?statement_node rdf:type wikibase:Statement (as described at mw:Wikibase/Indexing/RDF_Dump_Format#WDQS_data_differences, but not available here). However, given that this is a rather small data set, we can still do the string operation: SELECT * WHERE {
  ?s ?p [ wdt:P31 wd:Q58425000 ] .
  FILTER( SUBSTR(STR(?s), 1, STRLEN(STR(wds:))) != STR(wds:) ) .
}
 Try it! Seems like all constituency items are only values of electoral district (P768) qualifiers, and there is nothing else. —MisterSynergy (talk) 13:56, 6 November 2020 (UTC) Thanks very much. I had tried ?statement_node rdf:type wikibase:Statement but it didn't work. I wasn't sure if I misunderstood or if there was a better way to express it. I also didn't know you could run STR() on just the prefix. Very useful. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 14:49, 6 November 2020 (UTC) Filter fr description Hello I'd like to filter either french description or english description or NULL (having one row per item).

Q101104073 has no item description, which you have mde a mandatory requirement. --Tagishsimon (talk) 20:45, 6 November 2020 (UTC) I think, if I understand the question, this will find items where there is a French, English or Null (for all languages) description; it will emit the english if available, then the french.

DrThneed (talk) 01:35, 8 November 2020 (UTC) @DrThneed: More fu, above. This only really works up until more than 10k Scholia templates are used on en-wiki, after which it's hit & miss whether the academics found by the early clauses match those found by the search service. Right now, 1,311 such templates on en-wiki, afaics so NZ has first-mover advantage. Finally, to be very specific, we're getting people with NZ citizenship here.

  ?reftypeLabel Try it!I'm trying to build a good query that would show what references are used in an item that could potentially work and be displayed on any item.The above works somewhat for Franklin School (Q100000001) that has only 4 different references (+ some differences in formatting/reference url): the official website, myschool, some other website, the place name sign.If you change it to Q42, it's less condensed.Ideally the columns would probably be: the value of \"stated in\" (mainly label, possibly also the item) maybe also or alternatively, the label of the external-id property type of reference (if available) reference url (possibly external-id-urls included there as well) everything else available for the same reference could probably just be be concatenated in one column (not yet done in the above) + all claims using the reference (last column in the above) If there are some differences in the information for a similar reference, I don't mind if there are several lines (e.g. myschool in two lines for the sample above). The query doesn't fully join it to that point yet though.What do you think? --- Jura 06:24, 8 November 2020 (UTC) Facts from specific domain I am looking for all facts, containing certain relation, e.g. wdt:P361, bur restricted to a specific domain, let's say 'Artificial Intelligence'. Thank you! The hardest part of that request is to interpret what you mean. It may be this: SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel ?object ?objectLabel
{
  ?item wdt:P31 / wdt:P279* wd:Q11660 . # Find items in the domain
  ?item wdt:P361 ?object .

 Try it! or it may not. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 18:23, 9 November 2020 (UTC) United States Senators/House reps who have been astronauts Mainly inspired by Mark Kelly (Q357510), who was just elected last week. I figure this might be a neat query to have in next week's status update :) Nicereddy (talk) 03:40, 10 November 2020 (UTC) @Nicereddy: SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?position ?positionLabel
{
  ?item wdt:P106 wd:Q11631 . # Occupation: Astronaut
  VALUES ?position { wd:Q4416090 wd:Q13218630 } # US senator, US representative
  ?item wdt:P39 ?position .
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\" . }
}
 Try it! Additional information could be added like space missions, electoral district, election periods etc. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 11:10, 10 November 2020 (UTC) @Nicereddy, Dipsacus fullonum: This might also be of interest - SELECT distinct ?position ?positionLabel (count (distinct ?item) as ?count)
{
  { ?item wdt:P106 wd:Q11631 } union { ?item wdt:P106 wd:Q13188567 } union { ?item wdt:P450 ?mission } 
  # three ways to say \"went to space\" - occupation astronaut, occupation cosmonaut, was on a spaceflight
  # 
  ?item p:P39 ?ps. ?ps ps:P39 ?position . ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q5
  # they held some kind of position and also were a real person
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\" . }
} group by ?position ?positionLabel order by desc(?count)
 Try it! This query goes a bit further - it finds all positions held by someone who's gone to space, and the \"astronaut\" query is extended a bit to pick up about ten or fifteen extra people who don't have occupation:astronaut set. I think there's over a dozen legislatures in there, but it seems tricky to limit it to only elected posts.

How could it be done? NMaia (talk) 02:27, 10 November 2020 (UTC) I think you mean: https://pt.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ap%C3%AAndice:Falsos_cognatos/Esperanto That would probably be identical forms or lemma but different sense (one or several)? --- Jura 07:35, 10 November 2020 (UTC) @Jura1: Thanks. Yes, identical forms but different meanings. If the forms are the same and the meaning is the same, it doesn't count.
