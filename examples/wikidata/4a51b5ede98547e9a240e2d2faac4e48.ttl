As I have to test the name for certain spelling mistakes or dialects with the levenshtein-distance, I need a list of all human settlements from wikidata with a certain amount of data (name (german), alternate name(german), coodinates, ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of state were the settlement is located and the types of settlement (town, vilage, capital, and so on) I have trouble solve the task. As I understand, the query will need a lot of time, so I set up a local wikidata but I still do not get the information, as I need it. The problem is, that there can be more than one type associetaed to one settlement. so I have to group my output in order to prevent duplicate results.Here is my query so far: SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?altname ?coord ?staat ?kurz (group_concat(?art) as ?arten)

Arlo Barnes (talk) 04:07, 5 July 2020 (UTC) How to filter out the minimum value of an expression X and get more columns than that particular expression besides the column(s) for the GROUP BY by expression(s)? I have this result: ?item ?expression_X ?expression_Y item1 2 y1 item1 1 y2 item1 3 y3 item2 11 y4 item2 22 y5 item3 7 y6 item3 5 y7 With a query like SELECT ?item (MIN(?expression_X) AS ?min_X)
GROUP BY ?item I will get this. ?item ?min_X item1 1 item2 11 item3 5 i.e. just keep the one row per item with the minimum value on expression_X for the respective item.My question is: What type of query/subquery should I use to get the following result? ?item ?min_X ?expression_Y item1 1 y2 item2 11 y4 item3 5 y7 i.e. with the column for ?expression_Y kept? --Larske (talk) 12:09, 31 January 2018 (UTC) Don't have time to write you an example query, but I think the stategy is a query with three parts - first, turn the full existing query into a named sub-query, then set ?min_X to the minimum value of X in the results of the sub-query, than set ?Y to the value of Y that corresponds to ?min_X in the sub-query results. Jheald (talk) 15:01, 31 January 2018 (UTC) Interesting question. If I understand this correctly : https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#aggregateRestrictions then an approach like SELECT ?item (MIN(?expression_X) AS ?min_X) ?expression_Y
GROUP BY ?item ( … as ?expression_Y)
 – The preceding unsigned comment was added by TomT0m (talk • contribs) at 16:22, 31 January 2018‎ (UTC). (ec) I'll come back to the sub-query approach in a moment. Before that, here's a more basic approach, taking advantage of User:Andrew Gray's outstanding work on the history of the House of Commons in the UK to find the \"Baby of the House\" (ie the youngest MP) in each parliament. The approach is to have an inner query that finds the latest date of birth in each parliament, then an outer query that finds which MP in that parliament had that date of birth. SELECT ?parlLabel ?parl_start ?item ?itemLabel ?dob WHERE {
  {
    SELECT ?parl (MAX(?dob) AS ?dob) WHERE {
        ?item wdt:P39 ?parl .
        ?parl wdt:P279 wd:Q16707842 .
        ?item wdt:P569 ?dob .
    } GROUP BY ?parl 
  }
  ?item wdt:P39 ?parl .
  ?item wdt:P569 ?dob .
  ?parl wdt:P571 ?parl_start .
      
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }
} ORDER BY ?parl_start
 Try it! The query reveals a couple of anomalies in the earliest parliaments that Andrew is just getting to the clean-up stage for -- Thomas Williams (Q7793765) who was apparently elected at the age of twelve, and John Aldridge (Q26250395) elected at the age of minus three! (Pedantic footnote: the query doesn't check that the MP served for the whole parliament -- for example, like David Steel (Q333847) they may have been elected at a bye-election; in which case there might have been a different MP, not listed here, who had been baby of the House up until that point). Jheald (talk) 16:26, 31 January 2018 (UTC) I had a pattern for the subquery that seem to match yours : select ?item ?min_X ?y {

  { SELECT ?item (MIN(?expression_X) AS ?min_X) GROUP BY ?item. }
  
  [ triple pattern or subquery compute ?x and ?y from ?item using expressionX and expressionY ]
  
  filter ( ?x = ?min_X) .
}
 author TomT0m / talk page 16:37, 31 January 2018 (UTC) Let me get back to you on that. Meanwhile, here is basically the same query as before, but this time using a named subquery: SELECT ?parlLabel ?parl_start ?item ?itemLabel ?dob 
  WITH {
    SELECT ?item ?parl ?dob WHERE {
        ?item wdt:P39 ?parl .
        ?parl wdt:P279 wd:Q16707842 .
        ?item wdt:P569 ?dob .
    }
  } AS %sub_query_results

WHERE {
  {
    SELECT ?parl (MAX(?dob) AS ?dob) WHERE {
      INCLUDE %sub_query_results .
    } GROUP BY ?parl
  }
  INCLUDE %sub_query_results .
  ?parl wdt:P571 ?parl_start .
      
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }
} ORDER BY ?parl_start
 Try it! This runs slightly more efficiently, because it only looks up the dates of births for the MPs in each parliament once, rather than twice as in the original query. The solution set from this is stored in the variable %sub_query_results One can then INCLUDE it, as a solution set, in the main query. Above, we do this twice: first in the inner query, which finds the latest DoB for each parliament in that solution set. Then in the outer query, we match the parliament and the DoB from the inner query to the rows in the INCLUDED solution set -- this is just SPARQL joining the results from different solution sets in the usual way, by stating the relevant requirements one after the other. The result is a query that completes a bit faster -- and also is easy for the engine to optimise, because we have explicitly told it (with the sub-query) what part of the query to run first. Note, btw, that %sub_query_results is just a variable name -- we could have called it anything. Jheald (talk) 16:51, 31 January 2018 (UTC) Thanks Jheald for your assistance! The named subquery did the trick. I just had to refrain from changing the variable name in \"(MIN(?x) AS ?x)\" in order for the JOIN to work as expected. Btw, if you look for the oldest members in the different parliaments, you will find other anomalies, like Sir Charles Burrell, 3rd Baronet (Q7526182) who probably wasn's very talkative in the three parliaments he was member of three to twelve years after his death. --Larske (talk) 20:16, 31 January 2018 (UTC) Love it! Paging @Andrew Gray: :-) Srsly, Andrew's done/doing a brilliant job of cleaning this dataset up -- you can really see the cut-off of where he's got to so far, going back in time, and more recently than that the anomalies are very very few (if any?) Serious respect is deserved. Jheald (talk) 20:27, 31 January 2018 (UTC) @Larske, Jheald: thanks both for these queries - they're really interesting to look at! At the moment I'm importing data from the Historic Hansard database, and we know that has some... interesting issues for less prominent people. I'm going through in parallel checking records against more reliable sources where they seem inconsistent, but hadn't done a run on birth and death dates yet. People being listed as MPs after their death was a surprise! I'll dig into these a bit more and get them corrected - thanks again for spotting them. Andrew Gray (talk) 20:40, 31 January 2018 (UTC) @Andrew Gray: William Kirk (Q8014050) is another one who was a member of two parliaments after his death. --Larske (talk) 12:10, 1 February 2018 (UTC) Show only first image I have a query that works nicely: #defaultView:Map
SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?itemDescription ?locationLabel ?coord (SAMPLE(?img) AS ?img) WHERE {
        ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q1965390 .
        ?item wdt:P276 ?location .
        ?location wdt:P625 ?coord .
        OPTIONAL { ?item wdt:P18 ?img . }
        SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"de,de\". }
    }
GROUP BY ?item ?itemLabel ?itemDescription ?locationLabel ?coord
 Try it! Now some of the items have multiple images (e. g. look at the one dot that there is in \"Stuttgart\" right now), but I want only one to show, that's why there is the \"SAMPLE\" function. Is it possible to replace the SAMPLE part with something that shows me not any random, but only the first of the images in an item as in the sequence shown in the Wikidata user interface? How are multiple items in a property ranked anyway in a SPARQL query? Will the SAMPLE query always randomly chose, or will it at least chose between images of preferred rank? I can't find anything about that.What would be even better for my purpose would be a way to show a little gallery of all (or, say, the first 10) images in the item within that blurb that pops up on the map created by SPARQL (without creating multiple dots). Probably a feature request rather than a query request, but if it's already possible, I'd like to know it, too. Thanks in advance --Anvilaquarius (talk) 14:33, 2 February 2018 (UTC) If there are any images for an item that have preferred rank, then wdt:P18 will only see those, and won't see any of the others at all. In general this technique should only be used with caution, because you would also be hiding those images (or, more generally, values) from anybody else writing a query who only looked with wdt: The function MIN() can be used as a deterministic replacement for SAMPLE() -- here I presume it would return the first filename in alphabetic sequence, which may not be what you are looking for. If you want to select a particular image for each item, another approach might be to add a object of statement has role (P3831) qualifier to distinguish between the nature of the presented images. A sequence of OPTIONAL { } clauses would let you look for particular values in a preferential order. Jheald (talk) 14:53, 2 February 2018 (UTC) Thanks for the info. I feared so much... I didn't know about the \"preferred\" problems so I won't use this idea. --Anvilaquarius (talk) 16:54, 2 February 2018 (UTC) wd:Q468455 (death by burning) or wd:Q337935 (necromancy) Hi, I should want all women whom death by burning or by necromancy.

Why ? --Touam (talk) 19:47, 3 February 2018 (UTC) @Touam: Pretty-much nothing links to necromancy (Q337935) - see https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Q337935 ... so that element of the query will return little. Then, looking at the construction of the P509 / Q468455 clause, there does not seem to be a cause of death which is itself an instance of death by burning. Simpler by far to look for: SELECT ?iteme ?itemeLabel
WHERE {
    ?iteme wdt:P509 wd:Q468455;
            wdt:P21 wd:Q6581072.

Mahir256 (talk) 06:36, 6 February 2018 (UTC) Assuming you don’t have an account: create one at wikitech-wiki (I recommend to use the same user name as here) and set it up properly (you need to register public keys, and so on). There is “Getting started” documentation available at wikitech-wiki, and if something does not work as expected they help in the IRC channels. Once this is done, you can connect to the Toolforge console (login.tools.wmflabs.org, on Windows e.g. by using PuTTY) and do nano /data/project/bene/public_html/lonelyitems/index.php — or create your own tools. —MisterSynergy (talk) 06:44, 6 February 2018 (UTC) @MisterSynergy: Okay, I have created an account there and am awaiting approval of my membership request so that I can connect properly.

Do you or someone else familiar with connecting to (clone) databases know what the problem may be? Mahir256 (talk) 05:45, 8 February 2018 (UTC) No clear idea. Some files such as /data/project/bene/config.php are access-restricted for whatever reason, so we cannot look into them. Typically only ~/replica.my.cnf needs to have restrictive permissions (which it has by default), since it contains tool-specific database credentials. So I don’t fully understand how this tool connects to the database, the mysqli_connect_wiki() function is basically a black box. However, some weeks ago (November?) they have changed the aliases of the database hosts (see history of wikitech:Help:Toolforge/Database). I can’t tell whether the old ones still work, but this might be an issue here. —MisterSynergy (talk) 06:21, 8 February 2018 (UTC) @Mahir256: I managed to get a (temporary) clone of this tool running at tools.wmflabs.org/mstools/lonelyitems-clone/, with my own PDO database connector instead of Bene's approach.

Doc Taxon (talk) 22:59, 19 February 2018 (UTC) It uses the language the user has selected in their Query Service UI for the label service functionality, and an automatic fallback mechanism in case labels in that language are missing. It is typically given first or not at all, unlike in this example, and valuable for demo purpuses. —MisterSynergy (talk) 05:50, 20 February 2018 (UTC) My guess is that [AUTO_LANGUAGE] is the language that the user has stated in Special:Preferences.

I tried to set the statement ranking to \"deprecated\", but it's still showing up in the query. Strange. --Tkarcher (talk) 22:54, 22 February 2018 (UTC) @Tkarcher: Wonderful, thanks - you're a genius. Kennedy's entry for the 32nd is a known bug with the imports - the data source sometimes listed people as leaving office just after after the general election, which meant my parser assumed they had been re-elected and then stood down after a few days. Thought I'd got most of them but they still persist... As to why it's showing up despite being deprecated, this is because the p:/ps: approach includes all values, not just the \"best\" one(s) as wdt: does. This is very useful for P39s because quite often an \"important\" position (eg Prime Minister) is preferred for use in infoboxes etc, so the wdt: approach won't find the other positions. Andrew Gray (talk) 23:16, 22 February 2018 (UTC) Virtual graph ? Does anyone know whether it is possible to construct a virtual graph, and then use it in later parts of a query?As a concrete case, here is a query that almost works, but not quite.The following query attempts to give the stations on the en:Piccadilly Line of the London Underground, in order of their number of stops from the Cockfosters end: # Stations on the Piccadilly Line, in order from Cockfosters (almost)

SELECT ?station ?station_label ?depth
WITH {
  SELECT DISTINCT ?station WHERE {
    ?station p:P197/pq:P81 wd:Q207689 .
  }
} AS %piccadillyLine
WHERE {
  INCLUDE %piccadillyLine.
  {
     SERVICE gas:service {
       gas:program gas:gasClass \"com.bigdata.rdf.graph.analytics.SSSP\" .
       gas:program gas:linkType wdt:P197 .

       gas:program gas:out ?station .
       gas:program gas:out1 ?depth .
       gas:program gas:maxIterations 20 .
     }
  }
  ?station rdfs:label ?station_label. FILTER(LANG(?station_label) = \"en\")
} ORDER BY ?depth
 Try it! The key properties it uses are adjacent station (P197) and the qualifier connecting line (P81).The first part of the query successfully finds all the stations on the Piccadilly Line, and stores the solution set in %piccadillyLine (a Blazegraph Named Subquery). The second part of the query uses the built-in SSSP Blazegraph GAS program to spider out from Cockfosters tube station (Q1105305) to all items connected by adjacent station (P197), returning each item found (?station), and the minimum number of hops to get there (?depth).Joining on ?station between this set and the first set produces an answer which is almost right -- but not quite.Comparing to a map of the tube, like this one, everything is fine as one goes down the list until one gets to King's Cross St Pancras tube station (Q826120), which ought to be #12 on the list, just after Caledonian Road tube station (Q1026585); but instead is returned as #10 on the list, co-equal with Holloway Road tube station (Q1624885), just after Arsenal tube station (Q262548). What's happened is that King's Cross is indeed 12 stops away by Piccadilly Line; but it is also possible to get there in 10 stops, if one changes to the Victoria Line at Finsbury Park railway station (Q536796).So the question is this: how can one get the Blazegraph SSSP service only to spider by Piccadilly line connections, rather than by all adjacent station (P197) links?In principle I think one could solve this, if instead of creating %piccadillyLine as a solution-set in the first part of the query, if rather than that one could CONSTRUCT %piccadillyLine as a graph, of the form ?stationA my:predicate ?stationB; and then INCLUDE the graph, rather than the solution-set, in the second part of the query, and get the SSSP routine to spider over my:predicate links, rather than adjacent station (P197) ones.But does anyone know if this is possible? Jheald (talk) 13:27, 18 February 2018 (UTC) Update. I've been looking at this all evening, and I can't see a way to do it. One would think one might be able to use CONSTRUCT (eg as per tinyurl.com/y8krsfe7), to create a new graph that would then be accessible from the rest of the query. One could imaging the CONSTRUCT being placed in the body of the query itself; or maybe having to be done before the rest of the query, similar to how the named subquery creates %piccadillyLine in the query above. But it seems there is no provision for this in SPARQL. A query like tinyurl.com/y9ud5n43 returns the error \"Query is malformed\". I did read that it was considered quite seriously for the SPARQL 1.1 revision (and cf [1] (2008)), but it didn't make the release. Nor, as far as I can see, does Blazegraph offer any vendor-specific extension that could help. Instead, per the standard, CONSTRUCT can only appear once at the top of the query. I wondered whether federation could be used to get round this; but federation too can only return a solution set into the parent query, not a graph. If one were using one's own SPARQL set-up running at home, one could use INSERT to create a new table (as one query); then use SELECT FROM to specify to use that table; and then DROP it. But those aren't write permissions that can be given for WDQS. This could be quite a problem for us, because we use qualifiers so extensively -- for example to indicate statements that only applies to part (P518) or only when subject has role (P2868) or that have no end time (P582). There seems to be no easy way to exclude such statements -- and not just from Blazegraph's GAS routines (which may not be that widely used), but also no way to exclude them from path operations, such as P131* or P279* over located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) and subclass of (P279), which *are* that widely used. Yes, it's not such a problem with a toy example like this -- for a single underground line like this one can easily enough just download the data, and calculate the order offline. But that's not always the case. I think it may be quite a general thing, that one wants to query over networks that have a particular value of a qualifier -- or equally, that are made up of statements that are not qualified in a particular way. And I can't think of a way to do it. Pinging @Smalyshev (WMF): Is there any way you can think of to restrict the links used in SPARQL path searches or GAS programs, to exclude or only include values of a particular qualifier? Is there any prospect of proprietary extensions from Blazegraph, to path specification, or to their GAS routines, or to use of CONSTRUCT in sub-queries, that might help? Is there anything else you can think of, to work round this? Jheald (talk) 02:06, 19 February 2018 (UTC) Does anyone know whether it is possible to construct a virtual graph, and then use it in later parts of a query? @JHeald: I am afraid that beyond the subqueries in various forms that you already know about, the answer is no. The queried data set is read-only for the external user, and constructing new triples would require a write facility or some kind of federation facility which I don't think is present. What could probably be done is constructing the data outside by one query, then feeding them to the engine as VALUES in a second query. That would of course only work with very small sets of data, but if in your case you're talking about metro stations it would be small enough. I do not know a way to do this VALUES thing with a result of another query in SPARQL, but maybe I am still missing something. Smalyshev (WMF) (talk) 21:41, 23 February 2018 (UTC) @Smalyshev (WMF): Thanks. Is there any possibility that Blazegraph might be open to extending SPARQL, to allow SELECT ... FROM { CONSTRUCT ... } WHERE { ... ? It's a form that's been suggested by various people in the past, including that W3C wikipage above. I think at least one of their competitors offers it. Jheald (talk) 21:53, 23 February 2018 (UTC) I don't think VALUES would help, because this essentially lets you input a solution set, rather than a connected graph. So I think it wouldn't be able to do any more than the INCLUDE subquery results, used above. Jheald (talk) 21:58, 23 February 2018 (UTC) Implementing custom SPARQL features is a quite non-trivial chunk of work, so I wouldn't expect it happening very soon, unless somebody volunteers to do it. You are right about VALUES, this still creates bindings and not triples. If you want to create triples, that could be used as input for a different query, I am not sure the SPARQL engine has a facility now to allow you to do this... I am not sure it's possible at all to do on a read-only SPARQL engine without some non-standard extensions like SELECT FROM CONSTRUCT you've mentioned. Smalyshev (WMF) (talk) 22:05, 23 February 2018 (UTC) @Jheald: One possible option to overcome the read-only restriction could be to use a custom endpoint: Use a construct query, save the results, and feed them into your r/w endpoint. Then you can query that endpoint with federated access to WDQS. I've not tested this suggestion with your example and it takes some effort, but perhaps it is one way to get things done. Jneubert (talk) 09:45, 26 February 2018 (UTC) @Jneubert: Yes. If one was running something like ARQ on one's personal system, one could CREATE a new graph, then using INSERT (rather than CONSTRUCT) one could populate it using values extracted from a federated SPARQL query against the WDQS service. So that is possible. Difficulties include that one's personal SPARQL engine might not support the GAS services that Blazegraph offers (I don't think ARQ does for example); that one can no longer just give a link to WDQS to share the query with others; that it can no longer be used as the basis for a Listeria page, nor use WDQS added features like the graphing or map plotting or integration with Commons; that, for larger graphs, one might be having to transfer quite a lot of data for a relatively small solution set; and of course that one has to install and run one's own personal SPARQL service. But yes, this approach of gathering the data in to a system where one does have write access is one possible option.

 Try it!Hi! This is an example that runs into a timeout. What can I do to get the results?The quantity of entities in Wikidata has risen very much.

Thank you, Doc Taxon (talk) 22:49, 22 February 2018 (UTC) That query is technically okay, but nevertheless not well-shaped.

Doc Taxon (talk) 14:06, 23 February 2018 (UTC) Okay, good to know. The person to talk to is User:Smalyshev (WMF). —MisterSynergy (talk) 15:11, 23 February 2018 (UTC) The SPARQL endpoint is a shared service which currently serves 3 to 5 millions requests per day. We can not realistically deliver it if significant number of users sends requests that use major part of server resources for significant time. To ensure fair access and availability for all, there are timeouts. This will always be the case, we will never be able to serve arbitrary requests that require unlimited time to perform. The query above is definitely not a proper query - it basically requests all items that have subclass of (P279) statements. This is not a proper use of the query facility - if you need something like that, you'd be better working with LDF server or with the dump. Smalyshev (WMF) (talk) 18:12, 23 February 2018 (UTC) @user:Smalyshev (WMF): The query above should only show that there can be timeouts. There are no results really to use for anything. Please forget that thing. You said: \"This will always be the case, we will never be able to serve arbitrary requests that require unlimited time to perform.\" but you didn't say why not. We really don't need requests of unlimited time, but simply any requests that can be put to a longer timeout duration. Not unlimited, but longer limit. user:Magnus Manske has made a good suggestion, why do we not discuss about it with the target, to get a good result to provide any bigger requests. Wikidata is growing more and more, if we stand still, then SPARQL will be useless in time. Doc Taxon (talk) 10:13, 26 February 2018 (UTC) @Doc Taxon: We are well aware that there are timeouts, we created the timeouts, so there's no real need to prove it. The question is which queries are allowed on this shared service and which are not. Some queries - especially queries specifically designed to take a very long time - would not be allowed. If you need to run such queries, you need to make a case - why you need this, how important it is to run such queries, what would be the costs to run those and what are the alternatives, and then we can find the solution that is optimal for these specific requirements. Asking for every query, regardless of the costs, to be served by this endpoint is probably not going to happen. We'd be DOSed into complete uselessness - either on purpose or by series of accidents - very quickly.

First it finds all the items in the tree, then it sees which ones can't be linked by P279s.I think the second half of the query is reasonably efficient. The problem is the initial subquery, which ought to be a piece of cake -- 600 or so items, arranged in a direct hierarchical tree. Blazegraph ought to be able to do this in a fraction of a second. But currently just this initial subquery is taking at least 50 seconds, and the query as a whole is timing out.If the first part were a simple path relation, Pnnn* I think there would be no problem. But because it's a compound relation (p:P1014/pq:P361) that's being iterated over, Blazegraph seems to be making really heavy weather of it.Can anyone suggest a way to optimise this?

 Try it! Based on the precision, you can format the output properly. There are some ugly hacks possible to display \"properly formatted dates\" directly in the Query Service UI, but that is not good style. —MisterSynergy (talk) 15:34, 26 February 2018 (UTC) Yes, this is okay.

Sjoerd de Bruin (talk) 09:45, 28 February 2018 (UTC) Grouping result by entity, not by property Hi everyone,I'm dealing with the following query which gathers every painting with one or more depict properties.
