 Try it! What I was interested in was getting the border cities of South America (Q18) (except Guyana (Q734), Suriname (Q730) and French Guiana (Q3769)) so I'm pretty happy with the result. --190.226.77.162 13:59, 30 July 2019 (UTC) Note that there is a lack of data : not every city on a border has been flagged border city (Q902814). So if you see some of them, please add border city (Q902814) on their wikidatas page. Bouzinac (talk) 14:26, 30 July 2019 (UTC) I was adding that property to some South American cities that I saw in 1 and 2 and others may also be interested in marking other cities around the world so I took the liberty of adding the query in the examples. With regard to the query I was working with, I noted the following inconsistencies: El Amparo (Q1323834), San Antonio del Táchira (Q2602785) and Nueva Palmira (Q1023521) have two coordinates in coordinate location (P625). Yacuíba (Q328303), Tacna (Q272795), Municipio Autónomo Atures (Q2295357), Arauca River (Q1059928), Riosucio (Q2196660) and Tabatinga (Q22064419) are not border cities. --190.31.204.96 13:27, 31 July 2019 (UTC) Solved some obvious inconsistencies. I am curious : what is your definition of border town? I was in \"conflict\" with Hjart about Tønder Municipality (Q3162907) : he states his town wouldn't be called a border town, although it lies on the border Denmark/Germany. Would it be any cities whose shapes are touching another country (my preferred definition)? Or would it be any cities/town having its downtown/buildings very much touching another country ? Or any cities that have a means of transport between countries? Example : town A ==road==town B >>borders cities. But what if a mountain/river separates A and B, and no direct means of transport? Bouzinac (talk) 14:43, 31 July 2019 (UTC) Please note that Tønder Municipality (Q3162907) is not a city or town, but a large predominantly rural area and as such cannot fit the definition \"border town\". The main town Tønder (Q3223979) maybe could be called a \"border town\", since it's situated just a few kilometers north of the border, but IMHO isn't really a traditional border town in the same way i.e. Padborg (Q707345) is. --Hjart (talk) 16:24, 31 July 2019 (UTC) I've asked a similar question some time ago: \"what cities (or towns, or other populated places) share boundaries?\" (I can't find it in archives because of inexact wording). But it requires checking of O ( n 2 ) {\\displaystyle O(n^{2})} linkings which always timeouts. I wonder if someone can propose more effective solution. --Infovarius (talk) 12:06, 1 August 2019 (UTC) Federated query with lei.info Hi,We have many LEI code in Wikidata database.

Thanks.Ksarasola (talk) 16:34, 25 July 2019 (UTC) I can't help you directly with your question, but maybe this is interesting: User:Pasleim/Language_statistics_for_items has some statistics. For eu, there are 7.6 million descriptions. Obviously, it might just be \"Wikimediako argipen orri\". --- Jura 12:54, 2 6 July 2019 (UTC) You are right, @Jura1: That is not what I looking for. But thanks for your answer, your information could be interesting to know the number of descriptions in Basque and Spanish. 7,623,021 (13.4%) descriptions in Basque and 30,584,776 (53.8%) in Spanish. Ksarasola (talk) 21:14, 27 July 2019 (UTC) @Jura1, Ksarasola: Date of Birth is set to the Country, so I think we need to set it to anywhere in the country using: UNION { ?item wdt:P20/wdt:P131* wd:Q3995 } UNION { ?item wdt:P937/wdt:P131* wd:Q3995 } It also looks like the descriptions are of people only. PS I think you taught me that one! Llywelyn2000 (talk) 15:59, 29 July 2019 (UTC) @Llywelyn2000: The relation wdt:P19 is not 'Date of Birth', it is 'Place of Birth'. So I think the query is well formed. However, that query is not what I want. My goal is to collect all the concepts (or as many as possible) with description both in Basque and Spanish, whatever they are persons or not. But my problem is that when I remove this restriction (Born in Bilbao), even though I am still asking for humans, as the number of concepts is too big the query finishes with \"time out\". And I have no results. However what I want is to collect bilingual descriptions not only for humans, but for any comcepts. But in that case the problem will be bigger; if the nunber for humans is too big, the number of concepts will be even bigger. I think I should work with the Wikidata dump, I know it will be more complex, but it seems that it is the only way to get what I want. Thanks anyway.Ksarasola (talk) 23:35, 29 July 2019 (UTC) @Ksarasola: I meant Place of Birth, Froydian slip! Sorry. I agree that working on the datadump is the way forward. All the best! Llywelyn2000 (talk) 03:55, 30 July 2019 (UTC) Small step: Using the following query I get 840 items that are instance-of human and that have description both in Basque and Spanish: # Labels and descriptions of humans that have an article and description both in the Basque and Spanish Wikipedia

I think the regular search is actually a much better fit for this, because it has the hasdescription keyword: see Special:Search/hasdescription:es hasdescription:eu. If you’re familiar with the API, you can download up to 5000 results at a time (API sandbox) and follow continuation until you have all the search results; several API client libraries can take care of the continuation automatically (e. g. python-mwapi). --TweetsFactsAndQueries (talk) 13:34, 7 August 2019 (UTC) Chinese writers whose copyright expired Hi! I would like to know how to query a group like the title. I think the logic could be like this: they should have instance of = humans, occupation = writer. they should have native lang = zh/cmn/yue/wuu/nan/hak/gan/cdo, or lang spoken, written or signed = zh/zh-xx(all the varieties)/cmn/yue/wuu/nan/hak/gan/cdo/lzh. to determine copyright expiration, I thought of three ways: those who died before a given year, e.g. 1948 those who died in a given year (for example for those whose copyright expire in 2031, their year of death would be 1960). those who were born before a given year. (In case date of death is missing in wikidata, which is quite a common problem for Chinese people's items. Writers born 110+70=180 years ago definitely have copyright expired.)

I didn't know the ldf-query tool. It seems handy for this type of request. However, one web page for every 100 results is not easy to manipulate. Is there a way to get the result in a text file? I tried to add &application/ld+json at the end of the URL, with no luck. Should I use the WikidataQueryServiceR R package or is there a more convenient (ie on-line) way of getting the results in one text file?

I was a bit naive by creating this list, not expecting that so many people could have the same name. I may look at least common names, ones that sounds like people from Québec and see if I can identify their uniqueness and then create their element. Or not. Do you see another useful usage? Dirac (talk) 12:37, 9 August 2019 (UTC) You could pick one or several names and then disambiguation everybody else with the same name, e.g. Special:Search/Roger Moore haswbstatement:P31=Q5. --- Jura 15:03, 9 August 2019 (UTC) I realized that since there was 100 people per page, the 10K pages downloaded include the whole dataset. Hence, the classification includes everyone. 100k * 100 = 1M, which is a little bit more than 1% of the whole dataset. The file for this 1% can be found online here: https://octet.ca/arc/most-popular-names_P2093_wikidata.txt Dirac (talk) 12:50, 12 August 2019 (UTC) It's more like 940k of pages: [1]. --- Jura 17:23, 12 August 2019 (UTC) Q66426695, found thanks to WikiProject Random, probably appears in some 1000 papers on Wikidata .. but I think physicists are generally ignored in this type of stat .. --- Jura 20:06, 13 August 2019 (UTC) @Mfchris84, Jura1:, I've written an R script to address this. It moves author from author name string (P2093) to author (P50) with corresponding qualifiers and references. I'll try it on Q66426695. Do you have an idea how I could find unique author names with a lot of entries? Dirac (talk) 16:19, 17 August 2019 (UTC) @Dirac: @Mfchris84: I think it would be helpful to create and periodically update a list of values from P2093 (similar to the one you did) and check these. The problem with these values is that many are limited to an initial and a surname. If you delete common surnames, it might give better candidates, but it still doesn't exclude the possibility that you have people with the same given name(s) and family name writing in the similar field. BTW, have a look at https://tools.wmflabs.org/author-disambiguator/ sample: [2]. --- Jura 14:50, 20 August 2019 (UTC) HDS and WP The editor of the Historical Dictionary of Switzerland (Q642074) is interested to have a list of all Wikipedia articles (for example in English) which have the HDS identifier P902. I hope this an easy query for an experienced Wikidatian. I tried to create such a query but wasn't able to do it. Thank you for your answer. --Hadi (talk) 13:57, 21 August 2019 (UTC) @Hadi: Two queries for you. Item labels are fetched as your default language, and if a label in such a language does not exist, then the en, de or fr label in that order. You can amend the label choice in the wikibase:label statement. 1. Wikidata items with HDS ID: SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?HDS_ID
WHERE 
{
  ?item wdt:P902 ?HDS_ID.
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en,de,fr\". }
} order by ?itemLabel
 Try it! 2. English Wikiperdia articles linked to from Wikidata items that have HDS ID. You can probably see that to adapt this to e.g. French wikipedia requires only amendment of the URL in schema:isPartOf <https://en.wikipedia.org/> . SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?HDS_ID ?sitelink with { SELECT ?item ?sitelink ?HDS_ID
WHERE 
{
  ?item wdt:P902 ?HDS_ID.
  ?sitelink ^schema:name ?article .
  ?article schema:about ?item ;
          schema:isPartOf <https://en.wikipedia.org/> .
} } as %i
where
{
  include %i
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en,de,fr\". }
} order by ?itemLabel
 Try it! It's possible to do more than this, so if you want amendments, please come back for more. hth --Tagishsimon (talk) 14:50, 21 August 2019 (UTC) Thank you very much Tagishsimon! As the HDS is published in 3 languages it's interesting for them to have also the Wikipedia languages separately. I will try these searches and come back if necessary. --Hadi (talk) 15:31, 21 August 2019 (UTC) Get cities and town Can you help me to get cities and town certain country? thanks a lot – The preceding unsigned comment was added by 77.222.144.250 (talk • contribs) at 14:53, 21 August 2019‎ (UTC). It's as easy as SELECT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE {
  ?item wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q7930989.
  ?item wdt:P17 wd:Q159.
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }

It gets 3 items but the 4th - I don't know how to do. Also, how to make the NCT item optional (e.g., if no NCT property is there, don't require it) Similarly the wikipedia article may not exist. So I want an outer join. (get all trials and some trials will not have wikipedia page and will not have nctid.
