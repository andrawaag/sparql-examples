 Try it! Hi Trilotat. The only real change is that I added OPTIONAL { ?item wdt:P921 ?subject. } and the label service for ?subjectLabel, but besides that I also did several optimizations: Get the item directly from the MWAPI call instead of first ?page_title and then doing a manual conversion to ?item Don't get ?doi twice Remove the triple ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q13442814 from the SPARQL code because the MWAPI search already checks that condition. (Well, it doesn't check for rank. If that is important, reinsert the triple.) Don't turn the built-in optimizer off but instead move the MWAPI call to a named subquery to ensure that it is executed first SELECT  ?item ?title ?subject ?subjectLabel ?doi

A list of OSM wiki pages without links to Wikidata I want to create a mix'n'match catalog with OpenStreetMap Wiki (Q18635431) pages for tags, keys and relations that are still not yet connected to Wikidata. Using Sophox (Q55840137) instead of WDQS, I need, in this order: Entry ID (OSM wiki page URL title) Entry name (OSM wikibase item label) Entry description (OSM wikibase item description) At an earlier stage, @Yurik suggested this query, but I'm having trouble adapting it to what I need for mix'n'match. I apologize in advance for asking this here as I know Sophox is slightly different from usual pure WDQS queries, but I have few other options at this time.

 Try it! Times are normally recorded in days, which can get a bit confusing when their age is reported as eleven thousand! In the first version I've divided the age by 365.25 to give it in years, and in the second I've explicitly rounded it down to the whole year (so Bottas is 30, not 30.85). This might be more useful for adding up, as it's the normal way we report ages. Note that if we only have a year of birth for someone, it will count as 1 January.

Brand new user to Wikidata.I have this query: https://w.wiki/bdjI would like to include the referenceUrl on my website https://rembrandt-nono.netlify.app/ so when users click on the more button, they will open a new tab to either a wikipedia page or other source that will have more details on each item.I looked at the wikidata page for some of the paintings and there some(not all) Reference Url for that item. I haven't been able to figure out how to extract that data in my query. Also if there is a better way to extract the references pls let me know.Thanks in advance. N Hi. Note that reference URL (P854) is not used at the item level, but as a part of the references for an item's individual statements. If you e.g. want to see the values of P854 when used in references to statements with the predicate instance of (P31), you can add OPTIONAL { ?painting p:P31 / prov:wasDerivedFrom / pr:P854 ?reference_URL. }
 to your query. You can see a description of Wikidata's data model at mw:Wikibase/Indexing/RDF Dump Format. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 07:27, 9 September 2020 (UTC) Thank you.

 Try it! Thanks! -Theklan (talk) 21:52, 9 September 2020 (UTC) I see the problem. It is impossible to see where in Basque Country a line originates in a map of the whole world. I don't have a solution for that, but I can give a minor tip about SPARQL: instead of wdt:P131/(wdt:P131*) you can just use wdt:P131+ meaning one or more occurrences of wdt:P131. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 06:07, 10 September 2020 (UTC) Persons from a certain time period and country I would like to get a list of persons from a specific time range and country: The Sengoku Period (year around 1400-1600) of Japan.I looked at notable figures that is already on Wikidata and found a date of birth field on some of them.

(The actual list will come from a subquery, so I'd like to avoid using FILTER with a bunch of hard-coded || operators) Below is my stab at such a query where I'm hoping to omit Jane Austen if she is either a person OR a biblical figure. Apparently, the FILTER NOT EXISTS treats ?ignorableTypes as an AND condition rather than an OR, which isn't want I'm hoping for.

} Try it! Realworldobject (talk) 19:15, 10 September 2020 (UTC) @Realworldobject: Before the filter is applied you have a result with each value of ?ignorableType for each ?item. The filter do remove results for each match with an ignorable type, but leaves result with unmatched ignorable type. If you know the number of ignorable types, you can count the results for each item and filter out ?item where some results are removed: SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?typeLabel
WHERE {
  VALUES ?ignorableType {
    wd:Q5
    wd:Q20643955

 Try it! --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 13:50, 13 September 2020 (UTC) Thank you very much. For my better understanding, why if I use as deepcat Compositori I get no results whether if I choose a category below Compositori per nazionalità I get 7 results. If I understand, I'm sure I will take the most from this query. Thank you very much. --Goldmund100 (talk) 07:08, 14 September 2020 (UTC) @Goldmund100: It is caused by a bug in the deep category search. The search 'deepcat:\"Compositori\"' in the Italian Wikipedia gives only 3,616 results which are too few. The search deepcat:\"Compositori per nazionalità\" gives 4,579 results. The missing results in deep category searching is tracked in task Phab:T246568 in Phabricator. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 09:16, 14 September 2020 (UTC) @Goldmund100: PS. Please note that even when this bug is fixed, deep category search will not work if the number of subcategories exceeds 256. And the MWAPI service in SPARQL can as maximum return 5,000 results from the Wikipedia API, so the query will never work with too big categories. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 10:10, 14 September 2020 (UTC) Searching for people with a residence within X km from a given location Hi All,I've been using the following query to find African American artists in my museum's collections who have a residence listed in their record: Items used: human (Q5)   , African Americans (Q49085)   , Philadelphia Museum of Art (Q510324)   Properties used: instance of (P31)   , ethnic group (P172)   , has works in the collection (P6379)   , residence (P551)   """@en;
