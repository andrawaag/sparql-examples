I am new to SPARQL. So I am sorry for the case, I am asking a stupid question: How do I query multiple givenNames of a person? I tried something like this:SELECT ?human ?humanLabel ?familyNameLabel ?givenNameLabel ?givenName2Label ?birthName ?countryOfCitizenShipLabel WHERE { ?human wdt:P31 wd:Q5;
 OPTIONAL { ?human wdt:P734 ?familyName. }
 OPTIONAL { ?human wdt:P735 ?givenName. }
 OPTIONAL { ?human wdt:P735 ?givenName2. }
 OPTIONAL { ?human wdt:P1477 ?birthName. }
 OPTIONAL { ?human wdt:P27 ?countryOfCitizenShip. }
 SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"de\". } }Do you have an idea, how to select a second or third given name? Or even better: How to query for any given name. Thanks in advance! You don't need to use ?givenName2, you'll get all given names in ?givenName. Or do you mean series ordinal (P1545)? If you want specific name, just use wd:Qnnn instead of variable. --Infovarius (talk) 21:04, 1 September 2020 (UTC) Searching for p31=Q13442814 with title that begin with \"Erratum\" that have no P31=Q1348305 I hope to run a search for instance of (P31)=scholarly article (Q13442814) with that have (en) title (P1476) that begin with the word \"Erratum\" but also have no instance of (P31)=erratum (Q1348305).

Trilotat (talk) 14:28, 1 September 2020 (UTC) How to get data from wikidata using the QID I wanted to know how can I get data using QID. I have some names, I use falcon 2.0 entity linker curl command( change it into python script) to get information of its QID. Now I want to use that QID to get the persons gender( male or female) or alias or other information. Can someone give an idea how can it be done. The code to get QID is given below. the link to falcon 2.0 is https://github.com/SDM-TIB/Falcon2.0.import requests import jsonresponse_list=[] person_names=[]if __name__ == '__main__': limit=100
   with open(filename, 'r') as in_file:
       in_reader = in_file.readlines()
       for data in in_reader:
           if limit > 0:
               person_names.append(data.rstrip()) 
               limit -=1
           else :
               break

   \"\"\"
   
   
   url=\"https://labs.tib.eu/falcon/falcon2/api?mode=long\"
   headers = {'Content-type': 'application/json'}
   for name in person_names:
       data = {\"text\":name }
       data_json = json.dumps(data)
       response = requests.post(url, data=data_json, headers=headers)
       print(response.content) It gives output as http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q42493 for the entity. – The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:|?]] ([[User talk:|talk]] • contribs). Maybe Wikidata:Data_access would be a nice intro for you. --- Jura 17:56, 1 September 2020 (UTC) How to add subject to this query I like this query. I don't remember who was kind enough to create it for me. I'd like to use it to search if appropriate main subject (P921) has been added to the items. How do I add subject in a way that returns results? Thank you. Trilotat (talk) 18:15, 1 September 2020 (UTC) SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?title ?doi

 Try it! Hi Trilotat. The only real change is that I added OPTIONAL { ?item wdt:P921 ?subject. } and the label service for ?subjectLabel, but besides that I also did several optimizations: Get the item directly from the MWAPI call instead of first ?page_title and then doing a manual conversion to ?item Don't get ?doi twice Remove the triple ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q13442814 from the SPARQL code because the MWAPI search already checks that condition. (Well, it doesn't check for rank. If that is important, reinsert the triple.) Don't turn the built-in optimizer off but instead move the MWAPI call to a named subquery to ensure that it is executed first SELECT  ?item ?title ?subject ?subjectLabel ?doi

A list of OSM wiki pages without links to Wikidata I want to create a mix'n'match catalog with OpenStreetMap Wiki (Q18635431) pages for tags, keys and relations that are still not yet connected to Wikidata. Using Sophox (Q55840137) instead of WDQS, I need, in this order: Entry ID (OSM wiki page URL title) Entry name (OSM wikibase item label) Entry description (OSM wikibase item description) At an earlier stage, @Yurik suggested this query, but I'm having trouble adapting it to what I need for mix'n'match. I apologize in advance for asking this here as I know Sophox is slightly different from usual pure WDQS queries, but I have few other options at this time. NMaia (talk) 01:19, 28 August 2020 (UTC) For future reference, this was done, courtesy of @CamelCaseNick. Query (and query without items that have duplicates).
