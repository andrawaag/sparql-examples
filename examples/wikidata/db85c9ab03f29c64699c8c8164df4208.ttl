 Try it! Besides, if the template {{SPARQL}} was able to clean white-not very white-spaces ? Bouzinac (talk) 12:31, 2 February 2019 (UTC) @Bouzinac: There's nothing much wrong. Items are included in the query if they have a wdt:P47 wd:Q183 property/value, which Saarland does. You need to add further conditions if you want to eliminate non-countries. --Tagishsimon (talk) 12:52, 2 February 2019 (UTC) Ok, i've found out this query (raising same Saarland problem :) ) it shows the current neighbours of Germany SELECT ?border ?borderLabel ?country1Label ?country2Label ?isLandBorder ?isMaritimeBorder ?constraint {

Bouzinac (talk) 13:23, 2 February 2019 (UTC) Visualising gene structure 'is part of' relationships as diagram  I originally posted to project chat, but I've realised here might be a more sensible location to ask.Hello, I'm trying to encode the relationships and references in the two diagrams in w:Gene_structure within Wikidata. I feel like it should be possibly to recapitulate the structure of that diagram with a Wikidata Query network graph. Starting at Gene Edges of Property:P361, Property:P31, and Property:P279 in different colours (showing only those that have qualifier of (P642) eukaryotes. Edges down from Gene, but also across between elements Colour nodes by whether they are part of open reading frame, UTR or regulatory sequence Here is my first attempt butchered from a previous query written by Fnielsen because I cant work out the syntax enough to implement most of the features above. Any ideas on how to fix it? Evolution and evolvability (talk) 03:42, 31 January 2019 (UTC) @Evolution and evolvability: The Graph view doesn't allow to colour edges, see here. -- Luitzen (talk) 19:30, 31 January 2019 (UTC) @Luitzen: Ah, thank you. Can the edge labels be customised (e.g. 'P' for 'part of', 'i' for 'instance of'). Evolution and evolvability (talk) 01:21, 1 February 2019 (UTC) I've made an updated version, but I suspect there are still redundant parts. Any ideas on how to simplify it, perhaps with some sort of structure like this? PREFIX gas: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf/gas#>
