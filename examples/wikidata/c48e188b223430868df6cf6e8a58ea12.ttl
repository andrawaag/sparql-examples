There might be a few other tweaks that could be done, notably for title (P1476). --- Jura 16:15, 19 January 2017 (UTC) Film descriptions in ['es', 'ca', 'gl', 'ast', 'an', 'ext', 'oc', 'it', 'pt', 'sv', 'de', 'nl', 'fr', 'he', ] Good news, I just noticed that Emijrp's Emijrpbot (talk • contribs • logs) adds descriptions to film items! The details are in film.descriptions.py.Personally, I added them in English once in a while. I try to follow the sample at WikiProject_Movies/Properties#Description, but skip any films that don't have both director and year. I also skip films with many directors, these are generally anthology films. --- Jura 07:52, 5 March 2017 (UTC) The Bot is blocked now due too high editing rate. Queryzo (talk) 08:45, 5 March 2017 (UTC) Yeah I noticed, but that's mainly a problem with the website and should eventually be sorted out. --- Jura 08:47, 5 March 2017 (UTC) Some time ago I added a lot of Italian description, now I use quickstatments and this Listeria list that I elaborate with a spreadsheet. --ValterVB (talk) 17:14, 5 March 2017 (UTC) Hello! Bot is unblocked now. I am open to add more languages to the script (the latest language added is Arabic). Your help is appreciated. Emijrp (talk) 14:54, 11 March 2017 (UTC)@Emijrp: Would Hungarian be too much of a stretch? If we were to use the same data, the others use, it would look like this: \"[Hungarian label of director] [year][suffix] filmje\". The language of the label is important when the director's name is originally in a non-Latin script, because Hungarian often uses its own transliteration, but it also cannot be omitted, because without the name the rest of the description won't make sense as \"filmje\" means \"film of/by\" so without the name it should only be \"film\". The suffix is always necessary but depends on the number. Thankfully, all numbers will be four digit, which simplifies the process: if the last digit is 1, 2, 4, 7 or 9, the suffix is \"-es\" (e.g. \"2011-es\"), if the last digit is 3 or 8, it is \"-as\" (\"1988-as\"), if the last digit is 5, it is \"-ös\" (\"1995-ös\"), if the last digit is 6, it is \"-os\" (\"1936-os\"), if the last digit is 0, you check the digit before that: if the last two digits are 10, 40, 50 or 70, it is \"-es\" (\"2010-es\"), if the last two digits are 20, 30, 60 or 80, it is \"-as\" (\"1960-as\"), if the last two digits are 00, you check the digit before that: if the last three digits are 100, 200, … 900, it is \"-as\" (\"1900-as\", really there cannot be any other as of now) if the last three digits are 000, since the maximum year is below ten thousand, it is \"-es\" (\"2000-es\", yet again, the only option). How do you like it? So a complete example would be \"Barry Jenkins 2016-os filmje\". :) (See also function 'hanyas' in hu:Modul:Nyelvtani modul.) – Máté (talk) 18:03, 11 March 2017 (UTC) Property for film script(s) Should we create a new property to link items about film scripts? This could be an item about an online version, a published version in book form, or the specific copy held by a museum or an archive. --- Jura 15:32, 12 March 2017 (UTC) Here it is: Wikidata:Property proposal/film script. --- Jura 06:09, 15 March 2017 (UTC) In the meantime, this was created as film script (P3816) and I made an initial list, mainly based on images at Commons: Wikidata:WikiProject Movies/lists/scripts. --- Jura 06:19, 28 March 2017 (UTC) Property for key film scenes? How could we integrate details on specific film scenes? --- Jura 09:17, 25 March 2017 (UTC) You can simply connect them with the part of (P361)/has part(s) (P527) properties, can't you? – Máté (talk) 11:34, 25 March 2017 (UTC) I don't know. Do you? --- Jura 11:36, 25 March 2017 (UTC) I agree with Maté. Here is an example for Dumbo's Pink Elephants on Parade-Scene: Pink Elephants on Parade (Q29021559). But maybe you have other details in mind?--Valentina.Anitnelav (talk) 11:44, 25 March 2017 (UTC) The item you just created looks good. It's even more developed than I had imagined. Currently we only have few similar ones (4): SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?itemDescription
{
	?item wdt:P31 wd:Q282939 . 
	SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en,en\" }
}
 Try it! None seems to be using has part(s) (P527) leaving these somewhat lost. Anthology films use P527 to link their parts. --- Jura 13:35, 25 March 2017 (UTC) Here is a list of anthology films currently using P527: Wikidata:WikiProject Movies/lists/anthology films. Shall we create a new property for scenes? --- Jura 03:50, 11 April 2017 (UTC) I have no strong opinion here, as I see no real advantage/disadvantage in retrieving information. Maybe it would be more intuitive and thus encouraging to add scenes if there is an own property. -- Valentina.Anitnelav (talk) 09:56, 14 April 2017 (UTC) Gaps == Active users == ValterVB LydiaPintscher Ermanon Mushroom Queryzo Danrok Rogi Mbch331 Jobu0101 putnik AmaryllisGardener Andreasmperu U+1F350 Bodhisattwa Shisma Wolverène Tris T7 Antoine2711 CptViraj ʂɤɲ Trivialist 2le2im-bdc Sotiale Wallacegromit1, mostly focus on media historiography and works from the Global South M2k~dewiki Rockpeterson Mathieu Kappler Sidohayder Spinster Gnoeee Ranjithsiji Ontogon Supaplex Carlinmack Haseeb Demadrend Jakeob9000 RealityBites Sriveenkat Keplersj dseomn Fuzheado BeLucky DaxServer PaperHuman JerimeeNotified participants of WikiProject MoviesObviously we don't cover every single (e.g.) British film nor include an item about every TV series episode. Also we have a quite a lot of property to describe these, but most items are far from complete.Besides that, I was wondering where you think we have substantial gaps (properties or items). At some point, I noticed that enwiki keeps deleting articles about Indian actors, but I don't think these were covered in other languages either. Maybe our coverage of (e.g.) Indian cinema could need improvement. --- Jura 06:32, 31 March 2017 (UTC) First of all we need to be sure, how many items we got about TV series episodes for example. This query is a good tool to add IMDb IDs on single series. Queryzo (talk) 12:49, 31 March 2017 (UTC) Here is a query that gives some measure about TV episode items. Comparison with other websites is another way to do it, but I'm more curious about perceived gaps \"besides that\". e.g. Nigerian cinema is said to be very prolific, but [1] finds only 152 today. The two previous topics above address other gaps. --- Jura 08:25, 2 April 2017 (UTC) On Multichills disk page, we have created a new query using number of episodes (P1113) to get a list of the series with most missing IMDb IDs or items. So there's the question f.e. if we want to have all episodes of The Bill (Q929589) in Wikidata (2412 items). Queryzo (talk) 15:08, 23 April 2017 (UTC) For some series, enwiki has episode summaries in lists. It would be great if we could somehow get to retrieve these with the items if we create them. Otherwise the items are just a list of episode title translations (at least, until you split them by language). --- Jura 04:50, 1 May 2017 (UTC) Festivals and its award(s) Items used: film festival (Q220505)   Properties used: instance of (P31)   , has part(s) of the class (P2670)   SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?award ?awardLabel

I'm a bit hesitant to create these systematically.For the current year, the items would have the advantage that one could easily list the upcoming dates. This would be more precise than the Wikidata:WikiProject Movies/lists/film festivals this month.Obviously, it would be tedious to create these items manually, so some sort of bot would be good. --- Jura 16:24, 4 June 2017 (UTC) Language of film == Active users == ValterVB LydiaPintscher Ermanon Mushroom Queryzo Danrok Rogi Mbch331 Jobu0101 putnik AmaryllisGardener Andreasmperu U+1F350 Bodhisattwa Shisma Wolverène Tris T7 Antoine2711 CptViraj ʂɤɲ Trivialist 2le2im-bdc Sotiale Wallacegromit1, mostly focus on media historiography and works from the Global South M2k~dewiki Rockpeterson Mathieu Kappler Sidohayder Spinster Gnoeee Ranjithsiji Ontogon Supaplex Carlinmack Haseeb Demadrend Jakeob9000 RealityBites Sriveenkat Keplersj dseomn Fuzheado BeLucky DaxServer PaperHuman JerimeeNotified participants of WikiProject MoviesCurrently we have original language of film or TV show (P364) to describe the original language of a film and language of work or name (P407) for any additional languages voice is available. If there is a separate item for one or several dubbings, language of work or name (P407) can also be used on these.Apparently, the book specialists have problems with these properties on books (for whatever reason) and seek to delete or merge the properties once more (3rd attempt).Personally, I don't really mind what approach is chosen for books, but the current solution is fairly clean for films and works fairly well.How shall we proceed going forward? Oppose the the deletion or attempt to use a new property? Let things merge and then hope someone will eventually fix it? --- Jura 16:56, 26 February 2017 (UTC) As IMDb is not seperating them, I don't see why we should. Queryzo (talk) 17:02, 26 February 2017 (UTC) Not sure if it matters who does what. The question is how we want to proceed and why. I do think the original language of a film should be easily retrievable and not mixed with the information that a Russian version made available as well. --- Jura 17:28, 26 February 2017 (UTC) I agree with Jura. The original language of a film has to be easily retrievable and not mixed with other information. --Jobu0101 (talk) 18:10, 26 February 2017 (UTC) I think we should only claim the languages present in the original using original language of film or TV show (P364). Claiming the language for dubbed versions seems a bit problematic to me. Danrok (talk) 18:24, 26 February 2017 (UTC) Please do participate in deletion discussion. Property deletion reuests are often based on narrow segment of property usage and/or ingnorig its real usage in wikis. I do not think that \"separate item for each dubbing\" approach will be ever popular at movie items (at the moment less than 100 dubbing items vs. 224 000 film items), so keeping both original language of film or TV show (P364) language of work or name (P407) seems important to me. --Jklamo (talk) 20:48, 26 February 2017 (UTC) Why you're talking about dubbed versions? The IMDb gives Russian, German, an English, when these three languages are in the original film, so there are all original language of film or TV show (P364). Queryzo (talk) 20:56, 26 February 2017 (UTC) I think you are referring to a different question. language of work or name (P407) can list all languages in which film was translated (\"dubbed\"), e.g. an English language film into Russian, German, Spanish, French, etc. The question is now if we should just move films to separate properties or vote to keep the existing ones. --- Jura 05:07, 28 February 2017 (UTC) An alternative could be to just let original language of film or TV show (P364) be deleted and see if it gets sorted out/how much it deteriorates. In the meantime, obviously, I couldn't set the title any more. --- Jura 06:50, 12 March 2017 (UTC) == Active users == ValterVB LydiaPintscher Ermanon Mushroom Queryzo Danrok Rogi Mbch331 Jobu0101 putnik AmaryllisGardener Andreasmperu U+1F350 Bodhisattwa Shisma Wolverène Tris T7 Antoine2711 CptViraj ʂɤɲ Trivialist 2le2im-bdc Sotiale Wallacegromit1, mostly focus on media historiography and works from the Global South M2k~dewiki Rockpeterson Mathieu Kappler Sidohayder Spinster Gnoeee Ranjithsiji Ontogon Supaplex Carlinmack Haseeb Demadrend Jakeob9000 RealityBites Sriveenkat Keplersj dseomn Fuzheado BeLucky DaxServer PaperHuman JerimeeNotified participants of WikiProject MoviesLooks like the various properties will be merged.

I started with a wiki where the gap isn't too big and cawiki has a nice infobox using Wikidata. --- Jura 11:37, 14 August 2017 (UTC) It's now below 1%. Except a few video installations, all films that are only in cawiki have been covered. I noticed that a few directors had categories for films made by them, but no actual items. I also made Wikidata:WikiProject Movies/reports/unique films/Catalan Wikipedia and Wikidata:WikiProject Movies/lists/films by language/Catalan. --- Jura 09:24, 21 August 2017 (UTC) Year categories That's not really an interesting report, but the categories can be used to add publication date (P577) to films. Thanks to this, enwiki is now at 93% (from 90%) on Wikidata:WikiProject Movies/Numbers/unique films.

For others, it suggests the use of Duplicity (Q23751912). With Petscan, I add original language of film as well. Based on this, eventually title gets added. Others add more information.Now, if I'd do the same for English language films from some other Wikipedia, this is likely to create a duplicate, as the title of the Wikipedia may not be the same. Still, eventually, the original title might get added and we end up merging the duplicates. A good approach for these could be to search directly for duplicates, but this isn't that convenient, as Duplicity doesn't automatically retrieve the original title.Once in a while, some flooding user/bot creates tons of new items and we tend to end up with many duplicates anyways.I wonder how should proceed going forward: 1. should we just keep creating items for films and do at least some checking for duplicates: as Petscan does, at least for enwiki. 2. create items for new films every couple of days 3. proceed with (2.), but exclude wikis like nlwiki that routinely follow new articles and attempt to link existing items. 4. some other solution .. What do you think? --- Jura 07:35, 3 September 2017 (UTC) Difficult one. We want as little duplicates as possible. Whatever solution is chosen, please exclude nlwiki. Mbch331 (talk) 07:51, 3 September 2017 (UTC) Looks like GZWDer is doing #3 assuming someone will eventually clean up their duplicates. --- Jura 12:46, 10 September 2017 (UTC) Report new items: Indian films At the occasion of the new WikiProject India, I added the above report. --- Jura 12:38, 10 September 2017 (UTC) Silent films and films without dialogue == Active users == ValterVB LydiaPintscher Ermanon Mushroom Queryzo Danrok Rogi Mbch331 Jobu0101 putnik AmaryllisGardener Andreasmperu U+1F350 Bodhisattwa Shisma Wolverène Tris T7 Antoine2711 CptViraj ʂɤɲ Trivialist 2le2im-bdc Sotiale Wallacegromit1, mostly focus on media historiography and works from the Global South M2k~dewiki Rockpeterson Mathieu Kappler Sidohayder Spinster Gnoeee Ranjithsiji Ontogon Supaplex Carlinmack Haseeb Demadrend Jakeob9000 RealityBites Sriveenkat Keplersj dseomn Fuzheado BeLucky DaxServer PaperHuman JerimeeNotified participants of WikiProject MoviesThere is some discussion about the datamodel currently used for silent films and films without dialogue at Wikidata:Requests_for_deletions#novalue.

This was consistent with Wikidata:WikiProject_Movies/Properties#Episode.You might recall the discussion on Property talk:P1191 after which the description of the property was update to specify \"live-broadcast\" and publication date (P577) was added at Wikidata:WikiProject_Movies/Properties#Episode.Unfortunately, P1191 wasn't removed and still shows a sample for the Simpsons. Besides, most episodes used P1191. I don't think there are any live-broadcasted ones included in these series.The question is if we should change all episodes to P577 (and remove P1191 in the sample) or keep using P1191. What's your opinion? --- Jura 13:09, 12 March 2018 (UTC) I'd say use date of first performance (P1191) for live performances and live broadcasts, and use publication date (P577) prerecorded episodes/shows. However, there are odd situations: TV shows billed as being live, but are not really live, e.g. some chat shows are prerecorded earlier in the day that they're broadcast on, in front of live audiences. I'd say that these are not live shows, so use publication date (P577). Movie premieres at film festivals. This is where a film is shown for the first time on one screen only, and is the movie world equivalent of a theatrical premiere. To further confuse things some movies have several so-called premieres. These can be at cinemas as well.
