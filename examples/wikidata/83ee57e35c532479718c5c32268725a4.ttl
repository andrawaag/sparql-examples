And would you mind helping me fix this one please @Tagishsimon: ? @Anthere: With pleasure. iirc listeria requires its queries to provide a column of ?item values; no other variable name will do. So changing ?occupation to ?item has produced results. I've also removed a column (headed 'label') which was defined, but in such a way that it would never be filled.

Duplicates will arise if there are multiple P31s - but P31 values are not in the select, so a DISTINCT will get rid of them. Duplicates in located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) - and there were some - will also cause duplicate rows; dealt with now using group_concat. Duplicate values in any of the other selected fields would also cause duplicates, but there are none (that I have spotted). The problem with the sort was that it was case-sensitive; now it is case insensitive. hth. #Recherche dans Wikidata les éléments qui sont des archives (ou l'une de ses sous-classes) et qui ont pour pays la Suisse.

 Try it! My goal is to determine if there are any results from the above query that are included in Category:Musicians work group articles needing infoboxes (Q8654948). I will eventually add the Infobox person/Wikidata to those Wikipedia pages resulting in an infobox with those fields present. That's my goal, anyway.Thanks for your time. - Trilotat (talk) 16:52, 7 October 2018 (UTC) @Trilotat: Here is a query which starts to give you what you want, but might need some more work. First, I have to tell you that to get at references for a statement, you need to use p:, ps: prov:wasDerivedFrom, pr: and prv: values, rather than wdt: values. I direct your attention to the data model. On that diagram, if you start at Item you can see that you can get to a simple value using wdt:. But the plumbing is such that if you want the reference, you go down the p: path to a statement, and from there along a prov:wasDerivedFrom path to get a statement concerned with the reference, and from there along either a pr: or prv: path to get a property reference or a property referece value. Fun, huh? And super confusing until it clicks. So in this query I give you two selects. The first is what you're after. The second allows you to see properties/values associated with references. Swap the position of the # to use one or the other. And in short: for P19, reftype19 gets the property type for references, and the three filters exclude reference types we're not interested in - dates, \"imported from\", etc. However: until we either tie down which are valid references (e.g. stated in (P248) and explicitly require them; or tie down all unwanted reference type, and exclude them, the report will not be complete. For instance, take reference URL (P854) - that's probably valid, yes? But, umm, there may be some other reference properties (which I cannot think of) which you'll want to exclude. So. When you get a result you want to exclude, you can run the alternate select, work out the value that needs excluding, and add some more filters, or change the filters. You'll get there. I've used values ?human {wd:Q86701}. to constrain the results to Ernst. @Tagishsimon: Wow; thank you! I think I might be contemplating this for days, but I do hope I will get there. I try to \"reverse engineer\" what you've provided, but I don't know how to remove the values ?human {wd:Q86701}. I might understand it, but I don't know how to remove the code without breaking the query. Trilotat (talk) 20:10, 7 October 2018 (UTC) @Trilotat: So, I think you had a go at removing the values statement, ran the report, and got a timeout. Trouble is, the report is now looking across all 1.7M or however many humans we have; it does not have enough time to do this, and so times out. We only have 60 seconds or so of processor time before WDQS decides our query is rubbish and terminates it. So, the thing to do now is constrain the results, e.g. with reference to a requirement for an occupation (P106) or country of citizenship (P27) value, so that we're interrogating a smaller set of records. I've amended the example, below, to require the ?human to be German and a Lyricist. Now we get some results - and you'll see several rows for some individuals, because they have e.g. more than one occupation. (We could deal with this using group_concat, should we wish). I tried the query with German, Composer, but it timed out. So, the major problem going forwards is to design queries that will work within the timescale, but cover the ground you want covering. I've also added another query, mainly to show these statement things I was talking about - they're basically a URI which is used as a stepping stone from one part of the dataset to another. It might help you find your way. But the data model is your road map. Stare at it until it makes sense :) --Tagishsimon (talk) 20:43, 7 October 2018 (UTC) Come back with follow-up, and we'll probably get there sometime.

 Try it! Last created elements ? Hi,Is it possible to have the last created elements on wikidata with a sparql request ? The last created items of towns, the last created items of mens, the last created items of songs ? And see the result on a timeline ?Thanks. --Touam (talk) 16:07, 30 September 2018 (UTC) Hi, a simple way is to look at the wikielement number. The higher the number, the newest. Bouzinac (talk) 18:39, 30 September 2018 (UTC) Thanks ; and with sparql ? For instance, \"what are the last created items of songs\", since one month (for instance), request with sparql, see the results on a timeline ? --Touam (talk) 08:19, 1 October 2018 (UTC) @Touam: Plain old SPARQL will not give access to revision dates for wikidata records (to the extent of my knowledge). So as Bouzinac says, you can grab sets of records based on their QId, and an example for songs is below. As you cannot get any dates, you cannot have a timeline; just a regular table. And you need to make your own estimate of from which QId number you want the set. My example asks for QIds with numerals greater than 56000000; Vicenç Viaplana (Q56000000) was created 6 August 2018‎ so we're seeing a couple of months of songs. I don't know if there's a better way of approaching the greater-than element of the query below ... it's not very efficient. It is possible that there's an generator (such as revisions) which would allow us to use MWAPI to add revision dates to the query, or select with reference to a date parameter. But I know too little about this area to help; and suspect that there's an insufficient allowance of processing time to make this route useful. SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?items WHERE {
  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q7366.
  bind(xsd:integer(strafter(str(?item),\"Q\")) as ?items) .

 Try it! I think this would be find for me. --Fralambert (talk) 00:49, 9 October 2018 (UTC) Still not clear to me why you would want to remove the perfectly valid information in P969. Adding it to P669 does not require it to be deleted from P969. Your report limits the result set to items with P969, but it would probably be helpful to you to know which items already have P669, which is why I included tho two 669 columns. --Tagishsimon (talk) 00:52, 9 October 2018 (UTC) I may keep P969, it will probably more easy to keep it. But at least P669 have the advantage that I can find all the monuments on a street. --Fralambert (talk) 00:59, 9 October 2018 (UTC) Agreed.

And finally the list still needs sorting by day of the year, but I think I could do that with a python script.--Debenben (talk) 10:21, 13 October 2018 (UTC) Petscan can combine Wikidata SPARQL queries and Wikipedia categorization results, see petscan:6105316. However, with 4.8k results it is probably still not really useful and you need more criteria to find the important ones. —MisterSynergy (talk) 10:27, 13 October 2018 (UTC) Number of sitelinks and number of statements can be taken as proxies for fame (and who knows, the product of sitelinks multiplied by statements might be useful). I've added columns for both of these; filters could be added to require a certain number of either - and the query could be used in WDQS or Petscan. --Tagishsimon (talk) 10:42, 13 October 2018 (UTC) Thank you for your suggestions, I appreciate your help, I think we are getting closer. It looks like the exact dob and dod filter is working with petscan, I don't see the columns though. An additional filter like the number of sitelinks and statements as an indicator of fame is not a bad idea, however we also need the categories, e.g. Angela Merkel has many sitelinks and statements but not due to her work in physics. Her Ph.D. and scientific publications alone would not be enough for notability.--Debenben (talk) 21:39, 13 October 2018 (UTC) Mmm. We're not going to see #statement or #sitelink columns in Petscan; best we can do there is to set a filter requiring minimal counts. But yes. Our Swabian housewife problem. Not easy (although I thought that was why we were accessing DE categories). --Tagishsimon (talk) 22:08, 13 October 2018 (UTC) Maybe petscan:6111893 (dewiki Kategorie:Physiker + Wikidata P106:physicist or subclass, but no other P106, date of birth with day precision, more than five sitelinks). Petscan can only list items or articles, but no addl. data from the Wikidata items. —MisterSynergy (talk) 22:36, 13 October 2018 (UTC) Retrieve sub properties of a property I am looking to get sub properties of properties in my results.For example, if you take Bernie Sanders (Q359442) he has a list of positions held (P39).For a given position there are sub properties such as start date (P580) and end date (P582).If I do this I can access Bernie's positions held... SELECT ?position WHERE {
   ?person wdt:P39 ?position.
   FILTER(?person = wd:Q359442)
 } How do I then also retrieve the start date, as an example? @194.59.249.249: Like this - this query restricted to Bernie. select ?person ?personLabel ?positionLabel ?start ?end where
{
  values ?person {wd:Q359442}
  ?person p:P39 ?positionStatement . ?positionStatement ps:P39 ?position . # find positions they held
  optional { ?positionStatement pq:P580 ?start . }
  optional { ?positionStatement pq:P582 ?end . } 
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }
}
 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 14:07, 14 October 2018 (UTC) The data model is the thing you need to get your head around. Property qualifiers such as start and end date for a position, are only available via a p: statement value, not via the normal wdt: route. Come back if you want to discuss this futher. --Tagishsimon (talk) 14:13, 14 October 2018 (UTC) How to exclude something?

 Try it! And I'd like only one row per IATA /ICAO code. For instance, in AAL, BDA, CIY case, show, preferably, only civil airports. If civil and military, then only show the civil IATA row. If only military, then OK. Would it be possible ? Bouzinac (talk) 18:47, 11 October 2018 (UTC) @Bouzinac: It's an interesting problem and I suspect there might be several approaches. I've come up an approach, below, but it does necessitate identifying and ranking types of airports to support the requirement for civil in preference to military airports, for instance. So right now the report perhaps does not reflect the complexity of the airport ontology ... I've restricted myself to two airport types: airport (Q1248784) and air base (Q695850). And in short, I get the set of QIds for all items with P31=Q1248784 that have either an iata or an icao in a named subquery - %i ... and then I get the set of QIds for all items where P31=Q695850 and where the item does not have P31=Q1248784 (because such an item would be in the first list already) and by filters, exclude iata and icao codes which are associated with P31=Q1248784 items (so we eliminate the military duplicate at this point) and which have either an iata or icao, in a subquery named %j ... then I union these two and get the attributes of interest. You'll still get duplicates in this report where an airport has multiple values for any of the properties in the select ... if that's a problem then we can maybe start aggregating values. The report could (timeout permitting) be extended to cover additional airport types, by adding more named subqueries; or by extendng the scope of the P31 values selected in each subquery - albeit at the risk of introducing duplicates again. So there's a balance to be struck in developing the report, between completeness and precision and duplicate eradication and the timeout. What direction you go in depends maybe on how bad the duplicate situation is relative to your specific needs. All good fun. SELECT distinct ?item ?itemLabel ?countryLabel ?iata ?icao

FYI: I spoke to Hans Mehlin at Nobel Data 10 minutes ago and maybe they will have time to also clean the data they have, I guess Wikidata is better on recent deaths - Salgo60 (talk) 10:20, 12 October 2018 (UTC) Status update Thanks for the help the new query looks like it dont time out.

What would be nice to have in the list is the WD Sources in the list that confirms the fact ==> an external administrator could then easy check why Wikidata has a different fact and decide if the fact Wikidata state and is different from the administrators source is more correct/trustworthy than his/hers source that is different - Salgo60 (talk) 12:31, 12 October 2018 (UTC) @Salgo60: In the following query, where I have just included the Births (and removed the Gender and Deaths stuff) I have included the WD sources for date of birth (P569) if they are either a stated in (P248), a imported from Wikimedia project (P143) or a reference URL (P854). Other kind of sources may also be relevant and could be added to the query, but there also seem to be a lot of \"strange sources\" that will not be shown by this query. I also added the calendar model stated for the different birth dates. The 12 days difference for Nikolay Semyonov (Q48990) (\"Nobel Id 220\") may very well be caused by the use of different calendars. PREFIX foaf:  <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

It uses a named subquery to split the logic into your two sections. So, the first section finds the pertinent items, and aggregates on ?place to remove duplicates, delivering a list of ?place QIds as an array, %i. The second section incorporates the %i list, and then finds the relevant statements allowing it to get to the lat & long. fwiw, I moved ?place p:P625 ?statement . to the second query, as I found I could not get second query to work with a set of statements delivered by the first query's (SAMPLE(?statement) AS ?statementSample) ... so for me that's an interesting unsolved puzzle, albeit since moving the p:P625 to the second query is an effective workaround, it's not a big problem. hth.

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 11:17, 19 October 2018 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: Thanks for your answer. I have some questions: what does Qlds mean? I did not know about the possibility to declare arrays within sparql with \"AS\". Isnt this basically the same as my variable (e.g. ?place), denoting an array of answers? How does \"include %i\" function? Do you have an idea why the original query did not work? Thanks for your efforts - i am impressed! @JohnnyMoonshine: I'm not. Problem with the above query is that is does not tie the coordinate reported on in the second query, to the coordinate which was within 5 of the specified location in the first query. And, indeed, if the item has multiple coords, the second query will give multiple rows per item. So, generally incompetent, even if somewhat flashy. I think the query below corrects these issues, perhaps in a clunky sort of way. The wikibase:around service finds appropriate values of ?location: using a wdt:. but we need to look at the p: and psv: of the same location so I use ?place p:P625 ?statement . ?statement ps:P625 ?value. filter (?value=?location) to tie the lat & long values we report on, to the lat & long found by the service. (I have not, so far, been able to get the wikibase:around service to work with p: and ps:, which would have simplified matters somewhat).

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 11:49, 19 October 2018 (UTC) @ ‎JohnnyMoonshine: Oh. QId = the item number, e.g. Q12345. Named subqueries in SPARQL = something Blazegraph (the engine underlying the query service) gives us. Isnt this basically the same as my variable (e.g. ?place), denoting an array of answers? yes, pretty much, but named subqueries often tend to be faster, and more to the point, I have some confidence with them which I lack with nested queries. I don't know why your query did not work, but I suspect it might be that the subquery is not feeding ?statementSample back to the master query, much as I had a problem smuggling that value from my named subquery to my main query ... but this is nothing more than my wild guess. --Tagishsimon (talk) 12:00, 19 October 2018 (UTC) Identifying interwiki links that no longer exist Hi all. This is probably something for quarry rather than sparql, but is there a way to query for interwiki links that are on Wikidata, but no longer exist on Wikipedia/the other sites we have interwiki links to? E.g., at Suhana Khan (Q21122386), the enwp article no longer exists but we still have the interwiki link here. (I can then double-check that the article no longer exists using a bot, and remove the interwiki link here. Also see phab:T201371.) Thanks. Mike Peel (talk) 01:51, 24 September 2018 (UTC) This very tricky and could never be done effectively. At once, you can only query against a single wiki. The table which stores interwiki links on Wikidata stores them in a different format from that of Wikipedia page, so you can only query for a single namespace (unless you find a way to convert the namespace part to the namespace identifier). This is the best I can give now: USE enwiki_p;
SELECT CONCAT('Q', ips_item_id), ips_site_id, ips_site_page
FROM wikidatawiki_p.wb_items_per_site
LEFT JOIN page ON REPLACE(ips_site_page, ' ', '_') = page_title AND page_namespace = 0
WHERE page_title IS NULL
AND ips_site_id = 'enwiki'
AND ips_site_page NOT LIKE '%:%';
 With a namespace: USE enwiki_p;
SELECT CONCAT('Q', ips_item_id), ips_site_id, ips_site_page
FROM wikidatawiki_p.wb_items_per_site
LEFT JOIN page ON ips_site_page LIKE 'Category:%' AND REPLACE(REPLACE(ips_site_page, 'Category:', ''), ' ', '_') = page_title AND page_namespace = 14
WHERE page_title IS NULL
AND ips_site_id = 'enwiki';

Mike Peel (talk) 13:17, 24 September 2018 (UTC) That's odd. Looking at some of your https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/29907 \"moved page [..] to Draft:[..] without leaving a redirect\" seems frequent (samples: Q27671409, Q23664887, Q18754104, also recent: Q56292486). @Lydia Pintscher (WMDE): could we fix this? --- Jura 15:09, 24 September 2018 (UTC) I'm not sure I understand completely what's happening. Is the issue that someone moves a (presumably not notable or incomplete) article to the draft namespace? Then the link isn't moved on Wikidata because we block the draft namespace for sitelinks? And the link isn't removed from the old item? What's the behavior you think it should have? --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 20:05, 26 September 2018 (UTC) Same for userspace links. Seems to be intentional since we don't support them. Perhaps they should be dropped. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 15:44, 24 September 2018 (UTC) sorry about the english drama. fyi, it seems they have turned to mass moves to draft space, in lieu of deletion, for example [3] -- keeping the deleted links would work for me. after all, the deleted articles live on at everpedia.

Are they regularly being fixed or is the problem limited to enwiki? --- Jura 00:21, 25 September 2018 (UTC) @Mike Peel, Jura1: Thank you, this is very useful! @Lydia Pintscher (WMDE): I saw phab:T201371, but is there a more general ticket to track this issue? I agree with Jura that this should be fixed in a more durable way than volunteers running batches from time to time. It has a significant impact on statistics (example of enwiki with a drop in the number of biographies and an impact on gender gap; fun example of tgwiki). — Envlh (talk) 19:37, 6 October 2018 (UTC) @Envlh: Please see my question above. I need to understand it better to figure out how to solve it. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 15:59, 13 October 2018 (UTC) @Lydia Pintscher (WMDE): As I understand it, actual behaviour is much as you specify in your question: A sitelink to a wikipedia article is added to a wikidata item The wikipedia article is later moved to Draft space (without a redirect) Expected: the sitelink to the now removed article will be removed from the item Actual: the item retains a sitelink pointing to a non-existent article Example case Ramy Youssef (Q27969788), w:en:Ramy_Youssef, part of an en.wiki exercise to remove ~13,000 suspect articles by moving them to Draft with no redirect, and later deleting the drafts. In this case the article was linked to a newly created wikidata item at 20:52, 6 December 2016‎, the wikipedia article moved to draft at 13:42, 19 January 2017 and the sitelink persisted until manually removed at 17:26, 24 September 2018‎. Ideal if sitelinks were removed both in the case of an article moved to Draft with a redirect, and without a redirect ... I think Q27969788 only speaks to the second of those cases. (although tbh I'm much more dismayed by the completely different issue T168341; just sayin') --Tagishsimon (talk) 16:59, 13 October 2018 (UTC) @Lydia Pintscher (WMDE), Mike Peel, Envlh, Jura1, Tagishsimon, Matěj Suchánek: I suggest to close phab:T201371 and either create a new separate phabricator ticket for the scenario described by Tagishsimon or discuss the issue in a more prominent page like Wikidata:Requests for comment or Wikidata:Project_chat eventually.Robby (talk) 17:51, 17 October 2018 (UTC) Yeah that makes sense to me. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 13:27, 20 October 2018 (UTC) How to get area's unit of measurement?

So for each Public Domain Day we don't only have this kind of lists of people, but we would actually know which museums have which works of which people that are entering public domain.If I had this query I could then contact specific museums and ask them to donate reproductions of the works to Commons and data to Wikidata.

 Try it! --Larske (talk) 10:29, 22 October 2018 (UTC) @Larske: Amazing! Thank you very munch! This will help me a lot! Some difficult use cases: If I understand correctly collection (P195) is a required value in the query, so this query won't show the works that have no collection mentioned? Good to keep this in mind so that I don't interpret the results of this query as a 'full' list of works by these creators that have a record on Wikidata. The query only shows people that are mentioned as a creator (P170); so if a person has a role of an author (P50) he/she will not be shown in the list, correct? For example the works of Maurice Maeterlinck (Q49747) are becoming public domain in 2020, but he is not shown in the list. But I guess it will be difficult to take author (P50) also in this query as it is very often that works like book (Q571) or play (Q25379) do not really 'belong' to any collection (P195). What is your opinion about that? Maybe an easier query that shows al creators an authors that died in a specific year and their works will be enough for this use case?

(Note that this is dealing in absolute values; we should probably normalise the male and female counts to account for the disparity of males & females on wikidata; a quick frig to do that is to change the ratio maths to ?femalecount*485, which gives 'Merrill' as the nearest to 50/50 - m/f ratio on wikidata is based on https://denelezh.dicare.org/gender-gap.php) SELECT ?given ?givenLabel ?malecount ?femalecount ?ratio

 Try it! An attempt to mix up your version and my comments and reorganisation. author TomT0m / talk page 18:20, 20 October 2018 (UTC) There were a handful of stations that didn't have an opening date (tinyurl.com/yc2s477v), so I have edited the last two queries to make this OPTIONAL. I have also edited Tram stop Meent (Q1824137) to add the claim part of (P361) Amsterdam Metro (Q260870). With these changes, I think the queries now retrieve the complete network. @TomT0m: Personally, I don't particularly like using ; to suppress the subject of a statement, or [ ... ] to avoid naming an intermediate -- I don't personally find these syntaxes make queries easier to read, and certainly not for anyone new to SPARQL. But everyone has their own tastes, I think. Jheald (talk) 19:53, 20 October 2018 (UTC) Template:Pinq I think it’s not only a question of tastes, I think once you’re used to this notations they are cognitively less demanding. You KNOW for sure without checking that all the « ; » statements have the same subject, whereas if you repeat the subject you have to « check » this is a repetition of the subject. Naming of the intermediate [ ... ] tends to make lenghty names and lengthy code which is a rebuttal. In this example, just to get two coordinates I say this is pretty useless to explicitely expand and name the statement, and it’s definitely not worth the extra code. If it’s useless for the user to parse the name of the variable (and decode it) or to check where two lines that look like the same starts to diverge, maybe the variable is useless and the code is easier to read without the repetition. author TomT0m / talk page 09:04, 21 October 2018 (UTC) Both queries also updated to give names to the connecting lines, and colour them. Jheald (talk) 20:49, 20 October 2018 (UTC) The equivalent query for the London Underground. /tinyurl.com/y7qjwyoe. Still a few data issues. Jheald (talk) 20:56, 20 October 2018 (UTC) I've tweaked the London Underground version so that we constrain the coordinates for stations to a single value ... we had multiple lines where stations had multiple coordinates. Now, the only fail I've spotted in this area is the Northern Line segments between Euston, Mornington Crescent and Camden ... Northern Line has two branches, one of them appears not to stop at Mornington Crescent. I've also aggregated ?opening, since this was causing duplicate stations to appear. There's more work to be done here to allow us to select the ?opening value pertaining to the ?connect (e.g. for Vauxhall tube station (Q664375), where I've added a pq: of applies to part (P518) to the date pertaining to the opening of the Victoria Line; the 1848 date is the mainline). Were P1619 values appropriately qualified, we would move getting ?opening values to the %lines query (at which point we can constrain w.r.t. ?connect), rather than having it in the %station query. #defaultView:Map{\"hide\":[\"?coordinates\", \"?line\", \"?rgb\"]}

 Try it! -- Jheald (talk) 09:24, 21 October 2018 (UTC) These queries are interesting, but I question that they are \"good\". A metro usually follows more or less the streets, whereas the maps suggest that they are completely straight, below whatever. E.g. between Amsterdam Zuid and Europaplain, there is clear and big deviation between the straight line and the actual location of the underground rails. Steak (talk) 20:52, 20 October 2018 (UTC) <wonders if Steak knows how to pronounce Bombardier> Well, two things going on here, Steak. Are metro maps a good example of the capabilities of our line drawing fu? And are schematic transport maps appropriate. Herry Beck probably settled the latter question, although I grant that overlaying a schematic map on a representational map is a little troubling. That said, cut & cover metro lines tend to follow streets; deep tube lines not so much. --Tagishsimon (talk) 00:24, 21 October 2018 (UTC) Milan Metro map I saw this example on Wikidata newsletter and I was wondering how to reproduce the map of the Milan metro stations.

I: changed London Underground (Q20075) to Milan Metro (Q735559) changed ?connect wdt:P465 ?rgb . with ?connect p:P462 ?col . ?col ps:P465 ?rgb because sRGB color hex triplet (P465) is a statement of color (P462) which defines the color which the line are named with commented ?station wdt:P361 wd:Q260870 . because not all Milan metro stations have such property to define that they are part of the Milan metro Anyway, I reach timeout.

I think you probably got a timeout because, with the restriction to the particular Metro system commented out, your query would have trying to look up every railway station of every kind everywhere in the world. Jheald (talk) 13:23, 23 October 2018 (UTC) Here's a more generic version of the query tinyurl.com/ycn3nybz, which should just require the VALUES ?metro { ... } . statement to be changed; though some networks may need some data improvement. Jheald (talk) 13:43, 23 October 2018 (UTC) Tyne & Wear metro is missing connecting line info in the adjacent station properties ... but what do we think is going on with Whitley Bay station (top right) and Hebburn station on the current map? Both have small dots which, when clicked, transform into two larger dots one of which relocates the station, the other of which reveals a distinct new station. Very odd. --Tagishsimon (talk) 15:48, 23 October 2018 (UTC) Ah/doh. Two station records with the same coordinates. As you were. --Tagishsimon (talk) 15:57, 23 October 2018 (UTC) Thank you very much, Jheal! I tried to use your latest code to show Milan suburban railway stations but it doesn't work. Maybe because it is not a railway but a service, so it involves connecting service (P1192). Could you please adapt or - better - extend the code to show also these data? Thank you very much! --★ → Airon 90 16:56, 23 October 2018 (UTC) @Airon90: It doesn't look like the data supports drawing this map. No stations linked to Milan suburban railway service. No stations linked to discrete lines, such as Line S4. Until that is addressed, it's not happening. --Tagishsimon (talk) 17:01, 23 October 2018 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: OMG I though that I already added those data!

Using the US presidential elections as an example, you could look at all instances of United States presidential election (Q47566). SELECT ?a  ?aLabel ?ordinal
WHERE {
  ?a wdt:P31 wd:Q47566 .

 Try it! Using the series ordinal (P1545) property, you could number them so you now which one came before the other. Conversely, you could order them by date point in time (P585). To then see if a government gets reelected or not, you could see if the member of political party (P102) property of the successful candidate (P991) is different from the one before it? I have no idea how you would calculate that in Wikidata though. That's the first part of the query. The second part would be to cross-reference that with the economical data. you could look at metrics like the unemployment percentage in the year of the election versus the year of the former election, or the GDP of the country in the year of the election versus the year of the former election. That's all my insight, I didn't get farther than that first query, heh. Good luck!

 Try it! I'm running into several issues: entities are repeated several times, probably because of the administrative divisions, while I'd want to display only the top-level ones (the federal subjects); I'm trying to fetch the most recent revenue figures (if any - otherwise the entity should still be displayed). But without filtering a single year, it will show all years for which revenues are available, again multiplying the number of entities. The current query only shows companies in one smaller city (even a bigger one, like Moscow (Q649), will time out the query), while it should display all of them across the country, if possible.--Underlying lk (talk) 21:51, 25 October 2018 (UTC) @Underlying lk: Here's a first pass at the report. Right now it only deals with companies located in an Oblast or a Republic, but you can see the pattern if you want to extend this - I'm too lazy. From the bottom up, we require ?fedSubject to be an instance of an Oblast or a Republic. We find the HQ location, and then ask for a P131* which meets the Oblast or Republic condition. Next, we rely on the convention that series data (e.g. P2139 for multiple years) is arranged such that prior years have a deprecated rank; we remove any results with deprecated rank for the p:P2139 statement from our results with the minus statement. (At least, I hope that is the convention.) I've left the ?rank column in, since this is where we're most likely to have problems leading to multiple rows. Beyond that, lack of data will always get you; an example is Russian Railways (Q660770) which does not specify an Oblast or Republic, but jumps straight to the Country level, and so is a no-show. I suspect that poor P131 data combined with absent P159 is what leads to so few results. Back to you to investigate how useful all of this is & to think about where we go next. SELECT distinct ?company ?companyLabel ?town ?revenue ?revDate ?fedSubjectLabel ?rank
WHERE 
{
  ?company wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q4830453. #all businesses

I'd like to find using queries items where the en/en-ca/en-gb description contains \"Professional\" items where the en/en-ca/en-gb description contains unnecessary capitalization of an occupation (e.g. politician, [sport] player, [other popular occupations]) Are these possible? Jc86035 (talk) 08:12, 26 October 2018 (UTC) @Jc86035: Possibly only with difficulty. I think we hit timeouts if we try to look for \"professional\" in each and every Label or Description - too many of them. If you can cut down the search space, per the example below, you might get somewhere: SELECT distinct ?item ?itemLabel ?itemDescription
WHERE 
{
  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q5.
  ?item wdt:P106 wd:Q15117395.
  ?item rdfs:label ?itemLabel. filter(lang(?itemLabel)=\"en\")
  ?item schema:description ?itemDescription. filter(lang(?itemDescription)=\"en\")
 # filter (contains(?itemDescription,\"Professional\"))
  filter (contains(?itemDescription,\"professional\"))
}
 Try it! Next, though, we might need to worry about case - swap the # from one filter to the other in the above and you'll see that the filter is case sensitive. I guess a search for \"rofessional\" would work, if you want both upper & lower. And also, you need to specify in which of the Label or Description you want to look. And you'll see the filters which set the language you're looking for. Another approach, which is not as far as I can see case specific, is: SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel ?itemDescription
WHERE {
  hint:Query hint:optimizer \"None\".
  SERVICE wikibase:mwapi {
    bd:serviceParam wikibase:api \"Search\";
                    wikibase:endpoint \"www.wikidata.org\";
                    mwapi:srsearch \"Professional\".
    ?title wikibase:apiOutput mwapi:title.
  }
  BIND(IRI(CONCAT(STR(wd:), ?title)) AS ?item)
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }
}
 Try it! Albeit here we're not specifying the language of the search (we are specifying the language of the results though, with the Service). Dunno if any of the above helps. Oh. I suppose we could combine the two: SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel ?itemDescription
WHERE {
  hint:Query hint:optimizer \"None\".
  SERVICE wikibase:mwapi {
    bd:serviceParam wikibase:api \"Search\";
                    wikibase:endpoint \"www.wikidata.org\";
                    mwapi:srsearch \"Professional\".
    ?title wikibase:apiOutput mwapi:title.
  }
  BIND(IRI(CONCAT(STR(wd:), ?title)) AS ?item)
   ?item rdfs:label ?itemLabel. filter(lang(?itemLabel)=\"en\")
  ?item schema:description ?itemDescription. filter(lang(?itemDescription)=\"en\")
  filter (contains(?itemDescription,\"Professional\"))
}
 Try it! So that would be looking for uppercase \"Professional\" in the description field.

Simon Villeneuve (talk) 15:56, 26 October 2018 (UTC) Did minor changes to your regexp (assume the last ? is meant to be a $ ) and added an « str » to be sure to exclude the lang ( not sure that’s useful ), timeouts also after a few tenth of result, but you may be luckier with http://ldfclient.wmflabs.org/#datasources=https%3A%2F%2Fquery.wikidata.org%2Fbigdata%2Fldf&query=SELECT%20DISTINCT%20%3Fitem%20%3Ftitle%0AWHERE%0A%7B%20%20%0A%20%20%3Fitem%20wdt%3AP1476%20%3Ftitle%20FILTER%20(REGEX%20(str(%3Ftitle)%2C%20%22%5EQ%5B0-9%5D*%24%22)%20)%0A%7D%20 (although that’s slower, this may not timeout) author TomT0m / talk page 16:40, 26 October 2018 (UTC) Timeout too. this one has given A good result and I'm still waiting for other results after 700 seconds. Simon Villeneuve (talk) 04:57, 27 October 2018 (UTC) [0-9][0-9]* is the same as [0-9]+, easier to write :) author TomT0m / talk page 13:47, 27 October 2018 (UTC) Cities which are countries by themselves. (Self loop) I have a requirement to find the cities which are countries by themselves. I have tried, but unable find any output. Please provide a query for such self-loop or any related example. @PSWDA: I think you're going to have to explain what you think a self-loop is. If we consider Singapore (Q334) as a City and a State, and look at its instance of (P31) properties, we could use the city-state (Q133442) on its own; or look for a combination of sovereign state (Q3624078) and city (Q515), so: SELECT ?item ?itemLabel 
WHERE 
{
  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q133442.
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }
}
 Try it! or SELECT ?item ?itemLabel 
WHERE 
{
  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q3624078 .
  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q515.
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }
}
 Try it! and, mainly, we discover the first of these is more successful than the second. Clearly, we've not constrained these queries by time, so we get many historic city-states. Back to you - what was on your mind regarding self-loops? --Tagishsimon (talk) 15:00, 29 October 2018 (UTC) Acting tennis players by ranking I would like to fetch all the women tennis players from Biełaruś, having current singles ranking (so they got ranking (P1352) with sport (P641) = tennis singles (Q18123880) and max point in time (P585)). For now I selected all the women tennis players from Biełaruś or playing for Biełaruś, but their ranking is empty for some reason (it is filled though for instance at least here: Aryna Sabalenka (Q23448791)).

 Try it! Done. --Taravyvan Adijene (talk) 21:37, 27 October 2018 (UTC) @Taravyvan Adijene: What happened to max point in time (P585)? Also, are you sure you mean { ?item wdt:P19 wd:Q184. } and not { ?item wdt:P27 wd:Q184. }. Or, without checking, { ?item wdt:P19/wdt:P131* wd:Q184. }. --Tagishsimon (talk) 21:58, 27 October 2018 (UTC) And that's before we start discussing whether you really want to group by ?рэйтынг - which would seem to be inimicable to maxing P585 :) --Tagishsimon (talk) 22:00, 27 October 2018 (UTC) And, meanwhile, https://twitter.com/Tagishsimon/status/1056291017534697472 --Tagishsimon (talk) 22:01, 27 October 2018 (UTC) Hello @Tagishsimon: I noticed tennis players have only a single record about the ranking (P1352) combined with sport (P641) = tennis singles (Q18123880), so max point in time (P585) is not needed for them. But it will still be obligatory for chess players when I decide to adapt a query for them. Do you have any idea how to implement this check on the actual point in time (P585) value? You maybe have been noticed I use country for sport (P1532) instead of country of citizenship (P27) because I don't want to select tennis players who are playing for another country now. At least, not in this query. Talking about { ?item wdt:P19/wdt:P131* wd:Q184. } — I'm not sure I understand this notation as I never used it. I also wonder if asterisk has any meaning after wdt:P131? If I don't include ?рэйтынг into group by section — there will be a «Bad aggregate» error. How can I help you about twitter? --Taravyvan Adijene (talk) 21:48, 28 October 2018 (UTC) Good evening, my time, @Taravyvan Adijene:. In reverse order, the twitter thing was just to note that your use of a non-latin script led me to notice that WDQS does not properly mark up non-latin variable names, which seems regrettable for a supposedly multi-lingual service. Yes, as the query currently stands, if we don't include ?рэйтынг into the group by, there will be a «Bad aggregate» error. But were we to deal with point in time, then grouping by ?рэйтынг would probably prevent us from performing tricks with point in time. As it is - for the reason you set out, that there is only a single record about the ranking (P1352) combined with sport (P641) = tennis singles (Q18123880), it's fine. If in this query we did not have it in the group by, then we would need an aggregation function in the select, such as (sample(?рэйтынг) as ?рэйтынг). For this query, the result would be exactly the same as we currently get. An asterisk after wdt:P131 does have great meaning - see SPARQL property paths. For the place of birth property, { ?item wdt:P19/wdt:P131* wd:Q184. } says 'take the place of birth, and look up its located in the administrative entity value, and if necessary the located in the administrative entity value of the located in the administrative entity value, as many times as needed until we arrive at Q184. So, to use a local example, Place of Birth=Clapham Junction, Clapham Junction is in Battersea, Battersea is in London, London is in the UK ... we can construct a single line in the query which says 'give me all places of birth that are in this country based on a chain of P131 values. Very useful; and in general, property paths represent a powerful set of tools for getting the most out of a SPARQL query. Yes, good reasoning on country for sport (P1532) instead of country of citizenship (P27) ... but my concern was P19 versus P27 ... your explanation covers that, too, pretty much. So we're good on this point. I did some thinking about how to deal with max point in time (P585), but have been too idle to put it to the test. I'll maybe try to do an example query later tonight to see if my ideas work. It's not something I've done before, though it has been on my mind for a while now, so this is a good opportunity to stop talking and start coding. I'll ping you when I have something. --Tagishsimon (talk) 22:24, 28 October 2018 (UTC) @Taravyvan Adijene: So here's a version 1, finding the most recent population value for London. This version uses a named subquery, but I see elsewhere that we could as easily have used a sub-select to do the same thing - aggregate the values & find the maximum point in time. Blazegraph, the query engine on which WDQS is built, provides a facility to use named subqueries, and I tend to favour these over sub-selects becasue I'm more familiar with them and because it is very clear to me in what order the query works; I've seen elsewhere what looked like issues arising out of what I think might have been suboptimal choices on the part of the query optimiser when sub-selects were employed, leading to a timeout. The see elsewhere link above also documents another method, which uses a filter not exists within which there is a second filter, such that each row returned can be compared with another potential row and discarded if it is not the max - I've provided an example here as Version 2. Which approach you take depends in part on personal preference, in part on runtime. # Version 1 - using a named subquery
select ?item ?itemLabel ?pit ?value 
with                                 # here's the start of the named subquery

select ?item ?itemLabel ?pit ?value

      ?statement2 pq:P585 ?pit2.
      filter (str(?statement) != str(?statement2))

 Try it! I haven't figured out yet how to add a subquery to it, though it looks quite similar to SQL. --Taravyvan Adijene (talk) 19:39, 29 October 2018 (UTC) @Taravyvan Adijene: I'm too tired tonight to cope with a subquery, but the filter method is within my fading capabilities; I've inserted some code into your query, above. I've added a ?when column so you can check it out. The «элемэнтLabel» issue had not occurred to me. It's easy to live in ignorance of the privileges afforded by, for instance, doing stuff in English. We could raise a Phab ticket for this issue, though I'm pessimistic it would lead to change. There is a workaround, I think: (sample(?элемэнтLabel) as ?элемэнтэтикетка) seems to work; although it is an aggregation function, it will happily aggregate single values. { ?item wdt:P19/wdt:P131* wd:Q184. } will include items where the P19 is Q184 ... the * says 0 or more occurrences of P131 ... so you don't need to union it with { ?item wdt:P19 wd:Q184. }.+ hth. --Tagishsimon (talk) 21:30, 29 October 2018 (UTC) Order Islands by label (if they have one ...)
