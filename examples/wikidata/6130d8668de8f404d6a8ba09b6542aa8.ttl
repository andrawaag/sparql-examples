 Try it! I'm able to see the number of identifiers present in items having Mathematica Italiana person ID (P9114). Would it be possible, with a more complex query, counting only the identifiers having country (P17)Italy (Q38) ? I've tried some solutions but without success. Thank you in advance, --Epìdosis 20:06, 2 June 2021 (UTC) @Epìdosis: This sort of thing, I think. #title:count of Italian external IDs for Mathematica Italiana person ID people grouped by number of IDs

Thanks to you the second table of User:Epìdosis/Koha/Statistics is just born, I'm really really happy! Good night, --Epìdosis 22:52, 2 June 2021 (UTC) Group by century of birth Similarly, from the query SELECT ?id ?birth WHERE {
  ?item wdt:P9114 ?id .
  ?item wdt:P569 ?birth .
}
 Try it! is it possible to count people by century of birth? X people born in the 15th century, Y born in the 16th etc. Thanks, --Epìdosis 20:52, 2 June 2021 (UTC) @Epìdosis: This, probably. iirc from the Y2K era, centuries start at year 1 and end at year 100, rather than running from 0 to 99. So this will be looking for 1801-1900, rather than 1800-1899. (remove the -1 if you want t'other century definition) #title:counts of century of birth for P9114 people

  ?item wdt:P8034 ?id .
  ?item wikibase:identifiers ?ids .
  BIND((?ids) AS ?type)
}
GROUP BY ?type
ORDER BY ?type
 Try it! I can group the items containing P8034 by the number of external IDs they have.Similarly, through SELECT ?type (COUNT(DISTINCT ?item) AS ?count) WHERE {
  ?item wdt:P8034 ?id .
  ?item wdt:P106 ?occ .
  BIND(?occ AS ?type)
}
GROUP BY ?type
ORDER BY DESC(?count)
 Try it! I can group the items containing P8034 by occupation (P106).My questions are: regarding the first query: how can I group the results by ?type so that I have something like \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6-15\", \"16+\"? regarding the second query: how can I display the labels of the occupations and how can I show only the 10 most frequent occupations and group all the rest under the label \"others\"? Thank you very much as always! --Epìdosis 08:43, 3 June 2021 (UTC) grouping by range of values As you get one question for every 100 edits for free, you might still have a couple of questions left ;) Still, I think it's better to ask one query per section header .. For the first one, the following should do: Properties used: Vatican Library VcBA ID (P8034)   """@en;
