I'd like to run a query showing the comparison of coverage of villages and towns between a \"global north\" country and \"global south\" country. This would help us to show the information gaps that currently exist - specifically to Africa - and specifically English and French Wikipedia. I am open to suggestions, but which countries to choose? Nigeria is about half the population of the US. That might be a good comparison? Egypt, Ethiopia and Germany are all pretty similar population size. Is it possible to do this? Islahaddow (talk) 07:35, 19 August 2016 (UTC) There are 438 human settlements in Nigeria and 3180 in France (though that does include the overseas departements). These count all \"human settlement\" and subclasses thereof (city, town, village, etc). Of course, it may be that we have not yet imported all the places WP knows about in Nigeria - but that would be a problem in and of itself...

The result was that it took slightly longer (I think it was 802 ms instead 760ms). ;) Using the same optimization on P26 makes it run slightly faster. For properties linking two persons, I don't think anything from the above list beyond P569/P570 is that useful. There might be a few other not listed properties, but I don't think they are sufficiently frequent. The following query uses these:Properties: spouse (P26)   , date of birth (P569)   , date of death (P570)   SELECT DISTINCT ?item 
{ 
	{
		SELECT ?item WHERE {

 Try it! If you add the above, you will get the most recent ones. If you wait a couple of days till phab:T129046 goes live, you can select by number of sitelinks more easily.

 Try it! Matěj Suchánek (talk) 11:42, 20 September 2016 (UTC) ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ @Matěj Suchánek: That works, thank you. I tried adding ?predLabel: SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?pred ?predLabel ?value {
  VALUES ?pred { wdt:P1628 wdt:P2235 } .
  ?item ?pred ?value .
  FILTER( STRSTARTS( STR(?value), \"http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns\" ) ) .
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\" } .
} but that doesn't display the labels of P1628 or P2235 as I expected. How may I do that? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 16:48, 20 September 2016 (UTC) That's because you're looking up labels of wdt:P1628/wdt:P2235 and not wd:P1628/wd:P2235. You need to acquire those nodes first like this: SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?prop ?propLabel ?value {
  VALUES ?pred { wdt:P1628 wdt:P2235 } .
  ?item ?pred ?value .
  ?prop wikibase:directClaim ?pred .
  FILTER( STRSTARTS( STR(?value), \"http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns\" ) ) .
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\" } .

Matěj Suchánek (talk) 18:38, 20 September 2016 (UTC) People from specific territory and time I need a bit complicated query for people (P31:Q5), born (P569) after 600 AD and dead (P570) before 1500 AD, being born (P19) and died (P20) at places that are currently in Czech Republic or preceding countries (P17:Q213,Q42585,Q2162698) or directly in those countries (P19:Q42585,Q2162698 and P20:Q42585,Q2162698) or in combination (P19 place in P17:Q213,Q42585,Q2162698 and P20:Q42585,Q2162698 or P19:Q42585,Q2162698 and P20 place in P17:Q213,Q42585,Q2162698), and with born (P569) or dead (P570) date marked with P31:Q26961029.--Jklamo (talk) 10:25, 23 September 2016 (UTC) Not that much results but still: SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel ?born ?died {
