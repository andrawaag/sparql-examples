 Try it! The logical thing would be to think that the first result should be Alpha Centauri A (Q2090157) (since it is the closest to Earth), but in reality is COSMOS2015 489026 (Q75031832) which is 0.15 kiloparsec. Is there any way to detect the distances expressed in parsec and kiloparsec to convert them to light years? Otherwise, the distance from Earth (P2583) should be added in each star both in light years and in (kilo)parsecs and choose from the query which to use.--190.139.216.64 02:25, 20 February 2020 (UTC) There are two possibilities.

 Try it! I have limited both queries to 100 results before sorting because theywill timeout without a limit. There are 1,542,325 stars in Wikidata. I think it is impossible to search them all and convert the units in 60 seconds using SPARQL. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 05:15, 20 February 2020 (UTC) The most time-consuming part of the queries is the FILTER function (when removed its run almost instantaneously). Ideally, all these distances (light-year (Q531), parsec (Q12129), kiloparsec (Q11929860) and megaparsec (Q3773454)) should be stored in the database instead of being calculated on the fly and that everyone chooses the unit they prefer, I think that would improve the execution times of the query.--190.139.216.64 13:18, 20 February 2020 (UTC) Probably it's better to use \"wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q523\" as not all the stars have preferred \"Q523\" value. Also do you want e.g. brown dwarf (Q101600) (one is very close to the Sun)? They are even technically not stars... --Infovarius (talk) 10:14, 3 March 2020 (UTC) Most common kinds of items and what are the most common statements for them? I want to write some instructions for new contributors Hi allI'm not sure exactly what query I'm looking for but I'm working on schemas and other instructions for new contributors and I really like some information on common kinds of items so I know what people want to work on. What I would like to know is what are the most common 'kinds' of items are, as these, I guessing, are probably what they will want to create an item for. I guess this could be measured in a couple of different ways Most common statements overall (this will be useful for quick instructions for themed editathons etc) Most common 'instance of' Other very common statements and the most common values for those statements I assume there are a lot of people on Wikidata, to break this down a bit, what are the most common statements for people and what are the most common values? Once there's a list of the most common 'kinds' of items what are the most common statements for them e.g What are the most common statements for scientists?

The majority of sitelinks goes to Wikipedias anyway, so the filter uses time without limiting the results much. There will only be Wikipedias among the 15 first results, but if you increase the limit you can always add a filter after the grouping and counting by using subqueries – or take out unwanted results manually. Without filter and with P17 (country) changed to P27 (citizenship) I could run the query in 32 s without timeout. For items in USA (using P17) I think you have to query more specific subgroups in each query by adding more conditions with e.g. P31. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 22:42, 2 March 2020 (UTC) How to query all places within a place?

Regarding the label service - I picked up the above way of doing it from an example I was given - so I'm not totally sure of how it works. Please do tell me how to do \"language fallback for the labels you concanate\". It seems that simply changing FILTER(lang(?p31label)='sv') to FILTER(lang(?p31label)='[AUTO_LANGUAGE],sv') does not work. I'd like the result to be in Swedish, and fallback to anything else if Swedish is not available. @Robertsilen: Here is a version using the label service for the labels. It tries first for a Swedish label, then a Finnish and English label if none is found. Last resort will be the Q-number instead of a label.

 Try it! But all I have are IATA codes, geo coords and country. No continent (blanks). Moreover, I wasn't able to add city to the query as a property.And i receive lots of cases of duplicated IATA code because of different geo coords, for example: ROD Point(19.899918 -33.812355) ROD Point(19.903697222 -33.811775) Is there anyone that can help me obtain the result I need without duplicates?Thank you!--195.32.95.24 13:21, 3 March 2020 (UTC) Continent are blank because there are no values for airport items. continent (P30) are normally only used for countries, and in case of countries in more than one continent also in the largest subdivisions. So you would need to use a chain of located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) values until you found an item giving the continent. It can be a little tricky to do that and only select the correct values for countries in multiple continents. To avoid duplicates of coordinates the results can grouped by IATA code. I don't have time to write code for this now, but can do it later if no one else has done it. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 14:17, 3 March 2020 (UTC) Hi Dipsacus, thank you for your feedback.

First, there isn't data about continent for all places in Wikidata! When a country has parts in more than one continent, the code will try to get the continent from the largest administrative unit that the item is in instead of from the country. But that isn't always possible, so for some airports there will more than one value for continent, even though only one is true. Another problem is that there isn't time enough to handle all 8.745 airports with IATA code on Wikidata. So if you remove the limit on results, you have to also remove either all the code for continent or the code for labels (the SERVICE wikibase:label line) to avoid that the query times out.

 Try it! I don't know exactly where it breaks. Can someone help me figure out? Thanks! -Theklan (talk) 11:52, 4 March 2020 (UTC) @Theklan: Can you clarify how it’s broken? The potential problem I’m seeing is that it might be returning too many results (I’m getting 222284) – is that also your problem? --TweetsFactsAndQueries (talk) 19:46, 4 March 2020 (UTC) @TweetsFactsAndQueries: Instead of giving a list of 20 lexemes and their definition (it made that) now it gives thousands of repeated results with linked glosses that are not in the same language, and are not evident why they are there. For example I get: wd:L224884 independizatu wd:L22370-S1 stát v Evropě And it doesn't make sense, because independizatu (L224884) is not Suède (L22370-S1) and the word isn't a stát v Evropě. -Theklan (talk) 19:53, 4 March 2020 (UTC) @Theklan: Yeah, I think that’s due to the “produce all glosses that exist” I mentioned below (it would also, in reverse, produce the corresponding senses). I thought I had time to write the second part of my response before you’d see the first one, but clearly not, sorry :D --TweetsFactsAndQueries (talk) 20:00, 4 March 2020 (UTC) And as for the too many results, I think I just made a mistake in the query logic and it didn’t surface before because all the results had senses (I think). But if the inner query doesn’t find any senses for a lexeme, and ?sampleSense is unbound for some result, then I think the OPTIONAL in the outer query will produce all glosses that exist. I can’t think of a correct way to fix that, actually (the skos:definition triple needs to move inside the ontolex:sense OPTIONAL block, but then you’d need to do both SAMPLE(?sense) and SAMPLE(?gloss) in the same aggregation, and I think the two might select a sense and gloss that don’t match up), but maybe the sense isn’t actually necessary as a query output, in which case this should work: SELECT ?lexeme (GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT ?lemma; separator = \"/\") AS ?lemmata) (SAMPLE(?gloss) AS ?anyGloss) WHERE {
  SERVICE bd:sample {
    ?lexeme dct:language wd:Q8752.

 Try it! --TweetsFactsAndQueries (talk) 19:52, 4 March 2020 (UTC) No, wait, I found a solution that gives you the ?sampleSense and corresponding ?anyGloss without exploding the results. It’s a bit hacky, and a lot slower, though, so I don’t recommend it unless you really need both.

See en:Help:Searching#deepcategory:. The help page says: \"The depth of the tree is currently limited to 5 levels, and the overall number of categories is limited to 256.\" --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 10:34, 8 March 2020 (UTC) @Dipsacus fullonum: I think there must be some other problem with the deepcat search. The number of categories are just 40, well below 256, and the depth i just 2 levels (excluding the top level), well below 5. And if the limit(s) were hit, I think there should be a warning message on this search result page, but there isn't. I noticed that PetScan misses the 474 articles on the subcategories to Sailors (379 articles i 8 subcategories) and Volleyball players (95 articles in one subcategory). The total number of articles in the category tree is 11,211. --Larske (talk) 14:25, 8 March 2020 (UTC) @Larske: The deepcat search only gives 4.582 results (see https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&limit=5000&offset=0&ns0=1&search=deepcat%3A%22Competitors+at+the+2016+Summer+Olympics%22&advancedSearch-current={}) so the result isn truncated by the MWAPI service.

Pasting into Ordia's text to lexemes is what I have done so far, and I am using Listeria queries a lot for testing such things (example) but here specifically, I was wondering how this could be streamlined and perhaps triggered by some missing page on Scholia, as per this ticket.

It can run on all Zika article that currently exist. It shouldn't be too complicated to invert it (list the words that exist). --- Jura 23:04, 7 March 2020 (UTC) @Jura1: That last query is indeed very close to what I wanted (which is not entirely spelled out above), but it differs in some details, e.g. it does not list the corresponding lexeme's identifier. But this set of queries of yours has inspired me for several days, and as soon as I got the draft query above to work by adding some more OPTIONAL clauses to the problematic part, I started experimenting with incorporating some of your solutions. Thanks again! --Daniel Mietchen (talk) 01:37, 10 March 2020 (UTC) @Daniel Mietchen: I added another query that lists the lexical categories of corresponding lexemes (and one of these lexemes). If no lexeme is found, placeholder (L254535) is used. Maybe this could work for Scholia. I think we still need to find a good way to handle taxon names (see Property talk:P225#IETF tag for values and its parts e.g.). I revised the other queries slightly. --- Jura 13:29, 11 March 2020 (UTC) If it's not available yet, a service that does that on WQS would be good to have. Maybe with a federation query, one could try to do the conversion on another SPARQL server that has a corresponding extension installed (if there is).

 Try it! Hi! This runs into timeout since about 15 days. Before I got good results. How have I to optimize this query to get results? Thank you, Doc Taxon (talk) 13:48, 11 March 2020 (UTC) @Doc Taxon: I suggest you move \"?item wikibase:sitelinks ?sitelinks\" to the bottom of the subquery and add e.g. \"filter(?sitelinks >= 5)\". Without the filter you get 87.124 results. I doubt very much that you can use use so many results anyway and with a limit you avoid the timeout. I would also drop \"bind(xsd:integer(substr(str(?item), 33)) as ?num).\" and order by \"asc(num)\".

I never really considered using the MAX aggregation function because the revenue from the found time would have to be fetched afterwards, forcing the aggregation into a subquery. Besides a filter (albeit simpler) would be needed in the outer query anyway. Here is code with MAX() for comparison. The code with MAX() is a little bit slower than my original query above (1.7 s vs. 1.5 s).

There are instead the qualifier statement is subject of (P805) with the value 88th Academy Awards (Q20022969).

For example, 1000000 should be shown as 1.000.000 in most languages, 1,000,000 in english and 1 000 000 (using no-break spaces) in Swedish. Correct sorting based on the numerical value should still be ensured.One option would be some fancy SPARQL query code - can you help me with that? Another option to change the listeria bot code. Tomastvivlaren (talk) 23:46, 14 March 2020 (UTC) @Tomastvivlaren: I think the best way to do that would be to apply the formatnum parser function ({{formatnum:1000000}} → 1,000,000) on the wiki end – I think Listeria has options for that (wrapping result cells in certain wikitext). Do you have a particular page in mind where we can try it out? --TweetsFactsAndQueries (talk) 18:03, 15 March 2020 (UTC) @Tomastvivlaren: I tried it out at User:TweetsFactsAndQueries/sandbox, based on w:sv:Pandemi#Lista över pandemier i urval – it looks like the trick is to use a custom row_template, such as the one at User:TweetsFactsAndQueries/sandbox/row template, which is based on the Wikitext that Listeria generates by default but wraps the p1120 argument in {{formatnum:}}. --TweetsFactsAndQueries (talk) 18:16, 15 March 2020 (UTC) Thankyou @TweetsFactsAndQueries: for a professional solution. Nowadays when the listeria bot allows several SPARQL variables in the template, not only ?item, it should also be possible to output numbers formatted as strings using SPARQL code, but I have not succeeded yet. Neither the Query service, nor listeria, seems to allow all functions mentioned in the SPARQL documentation. Tomastvivlaren (talk) 10:30, 16 March 2020 (UTC) I think it is possible to do it in SPARQL but I think it is better to do complicated formatting of data like this with other tools after retrival as WDQS is a limited resource. But I wonder which SPARQL functions you are missing. I have never experienced correct SPARQL code not working (expect for timeouts) at WDQS. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 12:23, 16 March 2020 (UTC) Here is code to insert thousand separators in positive integers with up to 15 digits (e.g. population numbers). It could be expanded to decimal numbers, negative numbers or more digits, but I will leave that as an exercise for interested persons. I don't really recommend using this code. SELECT ?n ?formatted

 Try it! I cannot make a query for English Wikipedia articles starting with the word \"Vale\" that doesn't timeout.

In the hope I am not abusing (too much), I would like to ask the following questions: Is it possible to simply search for \"Vale \" (Vale followed by a space) instead of searching for \"\\\\bVale\\\\b\" ? Indeed the \\\\b seems do make the search much slower. And I don't know how to escape the space character. Is there any way to change the value of the timeout? I have patience to wait for results. Or is it possible to leave a query on the server and to come back later and check for it's results? How can make such a search directly on the English Wikipedia? I've managed to produce this search but I don't know how to search for \"Vale \" instead of \"Vale\" (again I can't escape spaces) — Ark25 (talk) 21:42, 27 March 2020 (UTC) @Ark25: You don't need to escape a space character as it has no special meaning i SPARQL strings: FILTER CONTAINS(?title, \"Vale \") and FILTER STRSTARTS(?title, \"Vale \") are both correct SPARQL code, but it is impossible search millions of titles in 60 seconds and it is not possible to change the value for the timeout. But the Wikipedias have indexes of all words so a search for words there will be almost instantaneously. Just search for intitle:Vale in the search field on the English Wikipedia. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 22:08, 27 March 2020 (UTC) @Dipsacus fullonum: Thank you very much for all your help! — Ark25 (talk) 23:15, 27 March 2020 (UTC) Mayors Hi!

 Try it! Mahir256 (talk) 19:45, 29 March 2020 (UTC) Great! Thanks a lot @Mahir256:. I will be more carful next time.--2le2im-bdc (talk) 19:57, 29 March 2020 (UTC) @2le2im-bdc: Also remember when using p: prefix that you get all statements including them with deprecated rank, and also normal rank even if another statement with preferred rank exists. To only access truthy statements as before you will need a filter like: ?describestmt wikibase:rank ?rank.
FILTER (?rank = wikibase:PreferredRank || ?rank = wikibase:NormalRank && NOT EXISTS { ?item p:P973/wikibase:rank wikibase:PreferredRank. })

 Try it! Thanks in advance --2le2im-bdc (talk) 21:43, 28 March 2020 (UTC) That's strange, in theory I think it should work. I would like to know exactly why it doesn't. @Lucas Werkmeister: any idea? That said, here a simple solution with adding a STR() on the label : #movie with P973 start with \"https://www.artfilm.ch\"
SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel ?réal ?réalLabel ?fam ?famLabel
WHERE 
{
  ?item wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q2431196;
        wdt:P973 ?describes;
        wdt:P57 ?réal
  FILTER STRSTARTS(STR(?describes), \"https://www.artfilm.ch\").
  ?réal wdt:P734 ?fam.
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en,it,de\". }
}
ORDER BY STR(?famLabel)
 Try it! Cdlt, VIGNERON (talk) 12:13, 29 March 2020 (UTC) @2le2im-bdc, VIGNERON: The label service is only documented to work on variables in the SELECT clause, so I see no requirement for it to work correctly for variables used for ordering. A test shows that it does work with ORDER BY ?famLabel if the manual mode of label service is used: SERVICE wikibase:label {
    bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en,it,de\".
    ?item rdfs:label ?itemLabel.
    ?réal rdfs:label ?réalLabel.
    ?fam rdfs:label ?famLabel.
}
 --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 12:41, 29 March 2020 (UTC) @Dipsacus fullonum: ah yes, obviously. I knew it but somehow forgot it, thanks. Cdlt, VIGNERON (talk) 13:21, 29 March 2020 (UTC) Thanks @Dipsacus fullonum, VIGNERON: but I see no change if I add label declarations in the SERVICE wikibase (without STR(...)). I am certainly missing something... #movie with P973 start with \"https://www.artfilm.ch\"

 Try it! Pour info @VIGNERON:, je trouverais bien si tu pouvais expliquer dans un de tes prochains live sur Twitch ce qui se joue ici au niveau du SERVICE etc. Je ne suis pas sûr d'avoir vraiment saisie! --2le2im-bdc (talk) 19:25, 30 March 2020 (UTC) @2le2im-bdc: oui bonne idée, je me le note.
