 Try it! @2le2im-bdc: As to why: it has to do with the Rank of statements, which can be 'preferred' 'normal' or 'deprecated'. wdt: will fetch items only if they have the best non-deprecated rank. Some countries have P31=sovereign state (Q3624078) set to 'preferred', and so wdt:P31 queries for country (Q6256) will not return them. See the documentation on statement types. By constrast the p:31/ps:31 route doesn't care about statement rank and so returns all items having the property. hth --Tagishsimon (talk) 21:38, 10 July 2019 (UTC) Fusión de Gita Gopinath Hola a todosNo se usar muy bien Wikidata y cree los datos de Gita Gopinath en español.

It looks accurate apart from the inclusion of Jimmy Carter, whose birth name was James Earl Carter Jr (sharing \"James\" with James Callaghan and others). I've now added those given names on Wikidata. Ronald Reagan appears on the list, but it's interesting that his middle name was \"Wilson\", which is currently the only surname shared by a US president and a UK prime minister. That is likely to change, of course, quite imminently.

I thought you would have a solution with a \"parent/child\" tree solution (something like \"Pierre\" << \"Pierre-François\" <<\"Pierre-Louis\" etc etc). The Escobar case is for now fine and I wondered how it would react with other given composed first names such as \"Pierre xxx\". It makes also me wonder how Wikidata is populated with such these composed first names : shall people get \"Pierre\" + \"Louis\" or only \"Pierre-Louis\" ? Bouzinac (talk) 14:03, 14 July 2019 (UTC) To get persons with such composed names just use \"?item wdt:P735/wdt:P527* wd:Q2045138.\" instead. --Infovarius (talk) 08:59, 15 July 2019 (UTC) Round to 2 digits after the point Sorry to bother you with that.

 Try it! Do you have any clue how I could improve the query? And I would love to place a city instead a country into the query but I was unable to retrieve any data :(Thanks for any help! Malte @Malte Hübner: Maybe: SELECT ?Timezone ?TimezoneLabel WHERE {

 Try it! - Q17272692 is a subclass of time zone (Q12143), which is used as the P31 for German's preferred time zone. So I changed the definition of a time zone in your query, and also looked for timezone statements the items of which have P31=Q12143 or are in the subclass tree - wdt:P279* - of Q12143. (Note that you get one row returned for Germany, despite it having four statements ... one is marked as preferred and so is the only one returned by a wdt: query.) --Tagishsimon (talk) 23:56, 18 July 2019 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: Thank you for your help!

The data returned does not look at all like I expected. Not sure what to make of it yet, food for thought. --Wolbo (talk) 19:27, 22 July 2019 (UTC) If I understand correctly, there is none of the listed items part of ATP Challenger Tour (Q299345) right now, otherwise add MINUS { ?item wdt:P361 wd:Q41792098 } as a new third line in the query above. Data is just awfully incomplete. I suggest to first make sure that all tournament editions are linked (have a part of (P361) and a suitable instance of (P31) claim), and then subsequently focus on the other properties. Most, if not all, tournament edition items will probably already exist. There is lots of information on Wikipedias, but for some reasons nobody ever tried to systematically feed Wikidata with tennis data. —MisterSynergy (talk) 20:26, 22 July 2019 (UTC) Hi, both 2018 Oracle Challenger Series – Newport Beach (men) (Q47483085) and 2018 Oracle Challenger Series – Indian Wells (men) (Q50323514) are part of the lower ATP Challenger Tour.--Wolbo (talk) 20:44, 22 July 2019 (UTC) @MisterSynergy, the two Challenger events have gone due to edits on these items. However the list only shows 16 tournaments whereas the 2018 ATP World Tour consisted of more than 50 tournaments. Seems like the list currently only shows the men's part of combined men's / women's tournaments.--Wolbo (talk) 19:04, 23 July 2019 (UTC) Yes, I have seen that User:Steak removed those claims.

I'm not able to make suggestions about the timeout of the query (other users will surely be able to); however, I want to make another suggestion. On Wikidata country of citizenship (P27)Italy (Q38) finds only people which where alive after 1946; people between 1861 and 1946 have country of citizenship (P27)Kingdom of Italy (Q172579) ; people dead before 1861 have neither.

The subquery resturns the selected \"persona\" with their respective \"dob\". These results are used by the main query to retrieve the other properties and the labels. To reduce the execution time I changed the comparison for sitelinks to just look for the \"pedia\" part, not the entire \".wikipedia.org/\". Another approach, if you can accepts persona with sitelinks to other wikimedia projects, like wikiquote and wikisource, could be to use \"wikibase:sitelinks\" to return the number of site links for the respective object and then FILTER for value greater than 0, i.e. replace the articolo stuff with: ?persona wikibase:sitelinks ?sitelinks .
