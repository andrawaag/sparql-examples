I read about the group_concat bug, added 2 variables for grouping but it breaks anyway. I bet you see the problem in a second. Another open issue is the image, I know I've seen an example where the output was limited on 1 value, but I cannot find it. #defaultView:Map

LIMIT 300 Try it!@Elya: I tried to fix it above. \"Query is malformed: Bad aggregate\" means that in SELECT you have unaggregated variables that are missing in \"GROUP BY\". Somewhere further down, it lists one ( \"Non-aggregate variable in select expression: coords\"). It's an error message I get frequently ;) I also changed the year and the image output to list just one. --- Jura 21:26, 1 March 2021 (UTC) Jura, aaaah, yes, I see. Thanks! I'll see what else I can do with my little dataset ;-) And I promise I'll read the error message stacks next time … --Elya (talk) 21:52, 1 March 2021 (UTC) @Elya: Your query select items that received Kölner Architekturpreis (Q1795794) and that received some unspecified award on some point of time. It can both be the same award and two different awards. You probably mean ?item p:P166 [ps:P166 wd:Q1795794; a wikibase:BestRank; pq:P585 ?date]. so the point of time is when Kölner Architekturpreis (Q1795794) is received and not some other award. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 22:13, 1 March 2021 (UTC) @Elya: Another thing: The query has the comment ?item wdt:P18 ?img. # might be more than one. I want the first one. There is no order of statements in Wikidata, so no image can be called \"the first\". You just get a image. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 22:21, 1 March 2021 (UTC)  Items used: Kölner Architekturpreis (Q1795794)   Properties used: image (P18)   , architect (P84)   , educated at (P69)   , coordinate location (P625)   , award received (P166)   , point in time (P585)   Features used: map (Q24515275)   """@en;
