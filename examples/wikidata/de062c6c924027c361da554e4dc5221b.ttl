 Try it! You cannot further process labels that were collected with the label service (as you want to do by group concatenation). rdfs:label and a subsequent lang filter is suitable for that purpose. —MisterSynergy (talk) 22:05, 27 April 2018 (UTC) MisterSynergy would it be possible to have a link to each property and as link label the propertyLabel? 77.179.61.171 21:40, 4 May 2018 (UTC) To my knowledge this is not possible in the Query Service GUI. You would have to query with a script, reshape the result to the desired format and output it e.g. by bot to a wikipage.

Each chapter or user groups that is present should colour that section of the map in (I realise this excludes the thematic organisations). This would basically be an animated map of the graph that appears in this page.I want this for two reasons: I'm running a Mozilla Sprint project to encourage people to add information to Wikidata about the open movement see here and would really like to use this as an example. I think a non timeline version could be used as a useful explorer for the Meta page on Chapters and User groups. If it could look like the maps on Wikidata:Wikidata_in_Wikimedia_projects#Maps_and_graphs that would be super amazing, e.g clicking on an area brought up website, contact info etc. To make sure the query is correct I guess there should be additional queries for number of chapters and usergroups, if a country or region is stated on their item etc. I'm very happy to do the legwork to fill in gaps.Thanks--John Cummings (talk) 15:00, 6 May 2018 (UTC) @John Cummings: Hm, I don’t think that’s possible as you describe it… as far as I’m aware we don’t directly support animated maps. A non-animated map with different layers for different years would in theory be possible, but in practice I don’t think we don’t have enough geoshape (P3896) statements on countries yet.

It will be hard to manually check what's wrong with those books. Many thanks again. --Wikidelo (talk) 13:37, 11 May 2018 (UTC) @Wikidelo: There may be nothing wrong. My books have been translated into languages I can't write - I'm still the author. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 04:14, 12 May 2018 (UTC) @Pigsonthewing: Of course, so the query excludes version, edition or translation (Q3331189). Now it also excludes, for example, works written in English (Q1860) by authors who speak British English (Q7979) or American English (Q7976) but it doesn't work viceversa, i.e.: it still shows works written in British English (Q7979) by authors who speak or write plain English (Q1860). I think this can be solved, but the main flaw of the query is in cases of books by two or more people, like The Aquariums of Pyongyang (Q492500), written in French (Q150), where Pierre Rigoulot (Q3386800) knows French (Q150) but Kang Chol-hwan (Q483097) does not, so the book appears in the list. I've not checked the 15000 results, but randomly looking at some of them I can tell there's a lot of people with languages spoken, written or signed (P1412) missing and, definitely, something wrong with a bunch of those books.

 Try it! which works well; but what should I change, to display the English and Armenian labels, in separate columns? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 12:46, 11 May 2018 (UTC) I tried to use two SERVICE's having bound different variables for each but it didn't let me. So the following is one possibility: SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel ?itemLabelHy ?coord WHERE {
  ?item wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q33506;
        wdt:P131 wd:Q1953;
        wdt:P625 ?coord .
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\" } .
  OPTIONAL { ?item rdfs:label ?itemLabelHy FILTER( LANG( ?itemLabelHy ) = 'hy' ) } .
}
 Try it! Matěj Suchánek (talk) 13:02, 11 May 2018 (UTC) Troubleshoot wdt:P31* I run this query that works excellent finding museums #defaultView:Map
SELECT ?museum ?museumLabel ?location ?dist ?img ?article ?URL WHERE {
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"sv,en\". }
  SERVICE wikibase:around {
    ?museum wdt:P625 ?location.
    bd:serviceParam wikibase:center \"[AUTO_COORDINATES]\".
    bd:serviceParam wikibase:radius \"10\".
    bd:serviceParam wikibase:distance ?dist.
  }
  ?museum  wdt:P31 wd:Q33506.
  OPTIONAL {?article schema:about ?museum;
                     schema:inLanguage \"sv\"}
  OPTIONAL{?museum  wdt:P18 ?img}
  OPTIONAL {?museum  wdt:P856 ?URL}
}
 Try it! as museums could be of a specific type I would like to change the query to something like this ?museum  wdt:P31 wd:Q33506. to ?museum  wdt:P31* wd:Q33506. ==> I get an timeout and I guess because of some bad structure. Question: How do I troubleshoot thatI have tested this workaround {?museum  wdt:P31 wd:Q33506}
 UNION
 {?museum  wdt:P31/wdt:P31 wd:Q33506} that works great but maybe I miss some more complex structures.... - Salgo60 (talk) 09:38, 12 May 2018 (UTC) wdt:P31* or wdt:P31/wdt:P31 don't make sense since superclasses are linked to using subclass of (P279) (not instance of (P31)). The correct \"complex structure\" is wdt:P31/wdt:P279*. Note that these queries tend to timeout. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 09:53, 12 May 2018 (UTC) Captain Cook memorials, and things named after him in Australia In the Australian press there was discussion about memorials, statues, etc. named after Captain James Cook. There was a comment whether Google could map such memorials, and I thought that it was an interesting query which Wikidata may be able to manage. Any takers to see what we can do? — billinghurst sDrewth 11:17, 12 May 2018 (UTC) #defaultView:Map
SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?coord 
WHERE 
{
  ?item wdt:P138 wd:Q7324;
        wdt:P17 wd:Q408;
        wdt:P625 ?coord.
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }
}
 Try it! Things located in Australia that were named after James Cook, shown on a map. The query returns 4 results. Shinnin (talk) 11:26, 12 May 2018 (UTC) 20 results in the example below, because named after (P138) is most often not populated. Changing \"Captain.Cook|James.Cook\" to \"Cook gives a much larger list, but with heaps of false positives. The ideal is to populate P138 for all items that are actually named after him. #defaultView:Map
SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?coord 
WHERE 
{
  ?item wdt:P17 wd:Q408;
        wdt:P625 ?coord;
        rdfs:label ?itemLabel. 
  FILTER(LANG(?itemLabel) = 'en')
  FILTER REGEX(STR(?itemLabel), \"Captain.Cook|James.Cook\") 
}

 Try it! Is it possible? Thanks. — Ayack (talk) 15:56, 7 May 2018 (UTC) It is: SELECT ?item ?INSEE ?itemLabel (CONCAT(\"[[Wikidata:WikiProject France/Églises/\",?INSEE,\"\\u007C\",?itemLabel,\"]]\") AS ?LIEN) ?depCount (CONCAT(STR(ROUND((IF(?_withCoord > ?depCount, ?depCount, ?_withCoord) / ?depCount) * 100 * 100) / 100), \"%\") AS ?withCoord)

 Try it! Matěj Suchánek (talk) 18:41, 7 May 2018 (UTC) Great! Thanks a lot Matěj Suchánek! — Ayack (talk) 11:16, 8 May 2018 (UTC) In fact, there is an issue: ?depcount is different from the initial query which have the right number. — Ayack (talk) 11:23, 8 May 2018 (UTC) I made a correction. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 12:37, 8 May 2018 (UTC) Thanks Matěj Suchánek! Results are right now. Do you know how to round percentages to two decimal places? I have tried ROUND() but it doesn't work. — Ayack (talk) 07:57, 9 May 2018 (UTC) SPARQL seems not to provide a function for this, so I hacked around it by multiplying the result by 100, rounding it and then dividing by 100. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 14:47, 9 May 2018 (UTC) If you want the column \"withCoord\" to be properly sortable, you may want to sacrifice the \"%\" by skipping the STR and CONCAT stuff and just use (ROUND((IF(?_withCoord > ?depCount, ?depCount, ?_withCoord) / ?depCount) * 100 * 100) / 100 AS ?withCoord) --Larske (talk) 06:14, 12 May 2018 (UTC) @Matěj Suchánek, Larske: Thanks a lot! — Ayack (talk) 18:49, 14 May 2018 (UTC) Unit conversionI want a list of units, their type, and conversion to SI units.
