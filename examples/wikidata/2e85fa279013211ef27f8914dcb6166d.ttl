- Jmabel (talk) 07:20, 1 June 2018 (UTC)The issue is that Texas Longhorn (Q390214) is not a subclass, so it can't have instances. I suggest making Texas Longhorn (Q390214) a subclass of organism (Q7239) or cattle (Q830). I'm not sure which is better, and really all taxon items need to be fixed like this. Ghouston (talk) 07:31, 1 June 2018 (UTC) I went with subclass of cattle. Thanks. - Jmabel (talk) 00:14, 2 June 2018 (UTC) This section was archived on a request by: Jmabel (talk) 00:14, 2 June 2018 (UTC) Why \"no label\" Can anyone work out why list of minerals A (Q1414866) is showing up as \"no label\" at Help:Modelling#Wikipedia lists? - Jmabel (talk) 17:21, 3 June 2018 (UTC) I fixed a redirect. --Pasleim (talk) 17:34, 3 June 2018 (UTC) Thanks! - Jmabel (talk) 00:42, 4 June 2018 (UTC) This section was archived on a request by: Jmabel (talk) 00:42, 4 June 2018 (UTC) List of Properties templates This page has a number of tables using the List of Properties templates.

I created a page on enwiki, which has (the topic has) a QID. Neither on enwiki, nor on Wikidata, I could find a tool/link/help to make the obvious connection (wd-enwiki link). -DePiep (talk) 00:43, 1 June 2018 (UTC) The trick is to add the en.wiki article as a sitelink - [2]. --Tagishsimon (talk) 01:41, 1 June 2018 (UTC) Wrong merges and links This and that bot-mergers have caused a lot of mess in the merged item, and a lot of links are now pointing to the wrong person. Somebody should clean this up. Steak (talk) 10:56, 28 May 2018 (UTC) @Pigsonthewing: I suppose it is your bot? Why is this happening? — Finn Årup Nielsen (fnielsen) (talk) 16:15, 28 May 2018 (UTC) Someone had applied the same ORCID iD and/ or other identifier to two different items. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 17:30, 28 May 2018 (UTC) The merger seems to reverted, but many links are still wrong, see e.g. this bot change. Steak (talk) 10:48, 1 June 2018 (UTC) Although worth noting that Pigsonthewing-bot was not responsible for that edit, Steak. I think if you do not identify the responsible user/bot in a posting like this, you diminish the chances of the bot being reined in by its owner. If you confuse an issue over here with an unrelated issue over there, then doubly so. And, of course, contacting the bot owner on their talk page first spares us all the drama, presuming that the bot owner responds to their talk-page poke. --Tagishsimon (talk) 11:51, 1 June 2018 (UTC) I'll revert them, thanks for bringing it up (and I second what Tagishsimon said). Matěj Suchánek (talk) 13:27, 1 June 2018 (UTC) Date of birth = 20. century Tracked in Phabricator Task T95553 I keep noticing that there are date of birth (P569) that look like “20. century” on people (e.g., Shamik Gupta (Q47250033), which turn out to read “2000s” when added to tables by Template:Wikidata list (such as this one). Are these correct? Very few people born in the 2000s would be notable yet by any standard. NotARabbit (talk) 01:01, 30 May 2018 (UTC) @&beer&love: Any thoughts? Mahir256 (talk) 01:48, 30 May 2018 (UTC) \"20. century\" seems to be the right format for an unknown date in the 20th century, so there may be a problem with code that's creating the table. Ghouston (talk) 02:00, 30 May 2018 (UTC) Actually, that may be wrong, it probably should be \"19. century\" for a date that starts with \"19\". Ghouston (talk) 02:02, 30 May 2018 (UTC) Playing with it a bit, it seems that it displays \"20. century\" if the underlying date is 1901-2000, with century precision, so my first guess is more likely. Ghouston (talk) 02:06, 30 May 2018 (UTC) I'm confused by it. Help:Dates says: Use \"1800\" with precision 7 to specify years 1800-1899, and it displays as \"18.century\", but does that mean that only years ending in \"00\" are valid for century precision? Ghouston (talk) 02:10, 30 May 2018 (UTC) This issue with Template:Wikidata list is known for quite long, @Magnus Manske: can maybe say more. Steak (talk) 07:29, 30 May 2018 (UTC) The people born in 19? and 2000 were born in the 20th century. The date accurately (07 = century) causes a series of problems in manual loading and automatic loading. I charge with date \"+ 2000-00-00T00: 00: 00Z / 07\" (full equivalence to manual loading: Load the year YYYY in the preview , so some load made by myself, and by other users with date for example 1953 (\"+ 1953-MM-DDT00: 00: 00Z / 07\"): in the preview is correct ( 20. century) but in the preview of the search in 1953. I will do 1 load Q19948171 with \"+ 1801-00-00T00: 00: 00Z / 07\" and \"+ 1901-00-00T00: 00: 00Z / 07\" and I will check. (preview: Andrew McCulloch Person (1801–1901) ♂; 1864-1945) Also to do the calculations of the Q21510854 in P570 use the year YYYY of (\"+ YYYY-00-00T00: 00: 00Z / 07\") in the manual loads and loads \"+ 2000-00-00T00: 00: 00Z / 07 \"It's the year 2000. I think that frwiki considers 2000 the 21st century (error) so he shows these people as \"21. century\". --&beer&love (talk) 07:52, 30 May 2018 (UTC) For births, could you use 1901 with precision 7 for 20th century? Avoids many problems. I'm not entirely sure if century precision is of much use for people born in that century, unless you actually attempted to find more information elsewhere. Floruit with a year would be better. --- Jura 08:11, 30 May 2018 (UTC) Ok.. in the next. --&beer&love (talk) 17:25, 30 May 2018 (UTC) There are two ways to interpret \"21. century\". Perhaps it's supposed to mean \"21st century\", so it would mean 2000-2099 or 2001-2100 (ok, there are 3 ways). Alternatively, it may mean \"2100 with century precision\" so 2100-2199. Help:Dates says it's the latter. Ghouston (talk) 09:18, 30 May 2018 (UTC) There's also a discussion at Help_talk:Dates#Century? and some tasks on Phabricator, but I think the confusion is universal. Ghouston (talk) 09:28, 30 May 2018 (UTC) Oh no. --- Jura 09:55, 30 May 2018 (UTC) Surely 1901 with \"century precision\" means \"some time between 1801 and 2001\"? There is nothing to say the precision is in one direction only. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 12:14, 31 May 2018 (UTC) @Pigsonthewing: The data model seems not to be a ± uncertainty, but based on truncation. E.g., any value 1950-1959 with precision \"decade\" will be displayed as \"1950s\". Likewise, you'd expect any value 1900-1999, with century precision, to be displayed the same way, perhaps as \"19XX\" or something, but that doesn't happen, since 1900 is displayed as \"19 .century\" and the other values as \"20 .century.\" Ghouston (talk) 05:54, 1 June 2018 (UTC) BTW, at Wikidata:Bot requests#Re-import P569 from dewiki, I found that many entries with century precision had more detailed dates at some Wikipedia. --- Jura 09:55, 30 May 2018 (UTC) :) Thanks --&beer&love (talk) 17:25, 30 May 2018 (UTC) The general specification for this is mediawikiwiki:Wikibase/DataModel. Mere mortals are not allowed to see how Wikidata stores information internally, but there are two alternative formats of importing or exporting data, which are specified at mediawikiwiki:Wikibase/DataModel/JSON and mediawikiwiki:Wikibase/Indexing/RDF Dump Format. All three agree that the precision value tells you what to ignore in the time stamp, and that the time stamp is inspired by (but not fully compatible with) ISO 8601. If you look at the edit summary for the example that started this thread, in March when the date of birth was added, you see the time stamp was +2000-00-00T00:00:00Z. The precision of 7 tells us to ignore all but the century digits, like this: +2000-00-00T00:00:00Z. So the statement tells us the person was born between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2099.The user interface does not interpret these values correctly on input, nor on output. \"20.century\" is utter nonsense. Jc3s5h (talk) 13:10, 31 May 2018 (UTC) Thanks @Jc3s5h:. If that's the data model, then the formatting is completely broken. Note only for the confusing \"20.century\", which people naturally guess means \"20th century\", but because 1950 with century precision is also formatted as \"20.century\". Ghouston (talk) 04:11, 1 June 2018 (UTC) @Lydia Pintscher (WMDE): One for you or one of your team to review, please. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 13:25, 1 June 2018 (UTC) Referencing coordinates to Wikimapia If I use WikiMapia (Q187491) to obtain coordinates for some place, and enter it into Wikidata, does Wikidata policy (1) allow me to reference the coordinates to Wikimapia.org and (2) require me to reference the coordinates to Wikimapia.org? Abductive (talk) 06:15, 31 May 2018 (UTC) You can reference coordinates to Wikimapia, and I would say this is definitely better than no reference at all. Pls be aware that mass (for example, bot-assisted) downloading coordinates from Wikimapia and, in fact, from many other places is likely not allowed.--Ymblanter (talk) 09:33, 31 May 2018 (UTC) Not that I have the technical ability to do so, but Wikimapia supposedly is CC BY-SA. Is that relevant? Abductive (talk) 18:14, 31 May 2018 (UTC) Indeed, and we are CC-0.--Ymblanter (talk) 19:49, 31 May 2018 (UTC) Perhaps you could 'splain that to a newbie? Abductive (talk) 19:56, 31 May 2018 (UTC) Data in Wikidata are licenced under CC-0 (everybody can use on any condition). Since the requirements of CC-BY-SA are stronger, data can not be mass-copied from Wikipapia to Wikidata, this would be a violation of the license.--Ymblanter (talk) 20:01, 31 May 2018 (UTC) I don't understand the difference, then, between using Wikimapia to find the coordinates for an item, and using Wikimapia to find the coordinates for lots of items. Abductive (talk) 20:23, 31 May 2018 (UTC) If you take info for an item, it does not matter what the source is as soon as the source is reliable. The source can even be copyrighted. A single fact is not copyrighted. However, a collection of the facts can be, and this depends on a number of circumstances.--Ymblanter (talk) 20:34, 31 May 2018 (UTC) What if a data collection such as Wikimapia's was used to detect errors in another database, such as Wikidata's, and only correct those errors? Or simply flag those errors? Abductive (talk) 21:19, 31 May 2018 (UTC) I am not sure I understand the question, but I guess it does not matter - if data are imported from Wikidata to Wikimapia they become CC-BY-SA and can not be imported back to Wikidata.--Ymblanter (talk) 07:27, 1 June 2018 (UTC) Volumes: volume (Q1238720) and annual collection (Q19816504) We seem to have two different items for the idea of a published volume of a larger literary work or series: volume (Q1238720)   and annual collection (Q19816504)   .Is there a meaningful distinction between them? Or should they be merged? Jheald (talk) 07:31, 31 May 2018 (UTC) Pinging @DavidMar86hdf: who created the latter item. Jheald (talk) 07:32, 31 May 2018 (UTC) The Source MetaData WikiProject does not exist. Please correct the name. -- Jheald (talk) 07:33, 31 May 2018 (UTC)WikiProject Periodicals has more than 50 participants and couldn't be pinged. Please post on the WikiProject's talk page instead. -- Jheald (talk) 07:36, 31 May 2018 (UTC) Looks like a clear case of merge to me. Mvolz (talk) 07:48, 31 May 2018 (UTC) Clearly different, as their English descriptions (\"A book in a series, typically identified sequentially (e.g. Volume 3)\" vs. \"collection of periodicals published in one year\") show. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 11:42, 31 May 2018 (UTC) @Pigsonthewing: OK, so is the intended distinction that Q19816504 should be used for periodical (Q1002697), whereas Q1238720 should be used for non-serials? But if that is the case then, (i) why is this a distinction worth making; and (ii) why does the Volume item properties table at WikiProject Periodicals suggest that periodical volumes should be instance of (P31) Q1238720 ? Alternatively, is the distinction that Q1238720 indicates a single physically-bound object, whereas Q19816504 represents a logical concept, of a number of issues of a periodical taken together? Yet this also has its limitations, because there are many multi works that may be split into physically-bound object designated eg \"Volume 3 part 2\". Yet I think we would still use volume (Q1238720) for these. Alternatively, as suggested by the German label \"Jahrgang\" rather than \"Band\", is Q19816504 specifically (and only) to be used to represent an annual run of a periodical -- often not a volume, because a journal may accumulate two or more volumes in a year. This last interpretation makes the most sense to me, in which case the English label should probably be changed. Looking at the statements on the items, Q1238720 includes the statement has part(s) (P527) issue (Q28869365) - another apparent indication that it is intended to be used for periodicals; and both claim to be equivalent class (P1709) http://schema.org/PublicationVolume - probably it is Q1238720 that should have this link, since Schema.org says of its concept only that it \"may represent a time span, such as a year\", not that it must do so. (Though it would useful to confirm with a native German speaker how strictly \"Jahrgang\" is limited to exactly a year-long run.) Most importantly is how they have been used. But here in particular there seems to be no great consistency, whether tinyurl.com/y7luwqd2 one limits to items that have a chain of statements making them part of a subclass of periodical (Q1002697) (only 6 items), or tinyurl.com/ybeux8t7 not. At the very least clarification, and clean-up, are needed. Jheald (talk) 14:40, 31 May 2018 (UTC) Having slept on it overnight, I have now made the following changes (diff1, diff2) which I hope will clarify the situation and make the relationship between two items more transparent: I have renamed Q19816504 in English from \"volume\" to \"annual volume\", and made it a subclass of volume (Q1238720). I have removed its claim to be equivalent class (P1709) http://schema.org/PublicationVolume -- I think the latter object is more strictly equivalent to the more general item. I have also added it to the Volume item properties table at WikiProject Periodicals, as an explicit alternative choice of P31 for a volume of a serial. I hope that seems sane, and now correctly represents the two items. @Pigsonthewing: Does this seem satisfactory to you? Jheald (talk) 12:54, 1 June 2018 (UTC) Mostly, thank you, though I'm far from convinced that a journal volume is a subclass of a book volume. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 13:15, 1 June 2018 (UTC) Lexicographical data: Replacing language codes by items in the user interface I have just started a consultation about removing language codes from the user interface in the Lexeme pages.

As far as I know, there aren't properties that can link a theorem with its proofs. Maybe we should have a \"proof\" (from the theorem to the proof) and \"proof of\" (from the proof to the theorem). Maybe only \"proof of\".It could be useful to have also an \"assumptions\" and a \"statement\" property - in addition to defining formula (P2534) - in order to separate the assuptions from the conclusion. Maybe also something like a \"natural language statement\" where we can write the definition of a concept or the statement of a theorem in natural language.--Malore (talk) 16:58, 1 June 2018 (UTC) New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture Could someone familiar with the subject please disentangle New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture (Q7014742) and Whitney Museum of American Art (Q9049779)?

He also knew that if he didn’t marry on earth, he would find his soulmate in heaven. \"Source: https://swedenborg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SF_TheCoreofJohnnyAppleseed.pdf – The preceding unsigned comment was added by Danc2 (talk • contribs) at 03:16, 2 June 2018‎ (UTC).

ArthurPSmith (talk) 19:35, 8 June 2018 (UTC) The inference at Help:QuickStatements#Removing_statements is that qualifiers can only be removed by removing (and then reinserting) their parent statement. --Tagishsimon (talk) 21:07, 8 June 2018 (UTC) This section was archived on a request by: Marsupium (talk) 18:09, 8 June 2018 (UTC) When a list does not have a subject Quite often, items are indicated as a list and associated articles include a list but there is no associated item for what the list is about. What I propose is to either change it from a list to the subject of a list or change the label so that it is obvious that the article is a list (in practice add \"List of\" to an existing label now using the label for the subjectmatter..Any ideas, comments? Thanks, GerardM (talk) 17:10, 31 May 2018 (UTC) @GerardM: It is increasingly irksome when articles about a subject and articles that are simply lists of that subject get conflated, as I've noticed at least when dealing with various India-related topics. If a prior item about a subject has been merged with a list item (as may be determined by looking at the latter's history), then I'd suggest undoing the creation of a redirect on the old subject item and then filling that in as appropriate. The following query may help to determine such conflations, but may not catch all of them: SELECT DISTINCT ?instance ?instanceLabel WHERE{
  ?item wdt:P31 ?instance.
  ?instance wdt:P31 wd:Q13406463.
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }
}
 Try it! Mahir256 (talk) 21:05, 31 May 2018 (UTC) I'm not surprised they get conflated, since lists are confusing. Is en:Ministries of the Netherlands a list article? Perhaps not, since it doesn't have \"list\" in the title and there isn't any other article for the topic in enwiki. But would anything be lost if ministry of the Netherlands (Q3143387) was conflated with list of ministries of the Netherlands (Q26720850)? The sitelinks would work better, and there's no Wiki that has a both an article and a list. Ghouston (talk) 04:03, 1 June 2018 (UTC) @Ghouston: In the specific case you bring up, it may be better to recast the enwiki page title as \"List of ministries of the Netherlands\" and move that sitelink to the list item, keeping the two items separate, as there is little of substance about Dutch ministries (history? overview? relations with the rest of the Dutch government? controversies? etc.) in the enwiki article besides the list. There should always be room made for articles about a subject item that go into more detail than whatever prologue a list article may have about the subject it lists. Mahir256 (talk) 13:23, 1 June 2018 (UTC) It seems to follow a pattern in enwiki, there's also en:British government departments and en:United States federal executive departments or even en:Great Officers of the Crown of France. They are curiously named in plural form, but not explicitly lists. Ghouston (talk) 22:45, 1 June 2018 (UTC) Links to Wikipedia are beside the point. The question is what do we do at Wikidata. Either we accept list articles for the subject and rename them as such or we accept them as a list and create items for the subject. The consequence is that we either link from items to the list article or we create links to the newly created item. Never mind what happens elsewhere. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 17:24, 2 June 2018 (UTC) It seems to me that list items on Wikidata are only useful when some other site has both an article and a list article, and their only use is for holding sitelinks. In other cases, all the sitelinks could go on a single Wikidata item, even if some had \"list\" in their titles. Also, the list item only needs to hold sitelinks for sites that do have a 2nd article, all the others could go on the main item. Ghouston (talk) 23:26, 2 June 2018 (UTC) Field of work for awards I notice some items like film award (Q4220917) and C.L. de Carvalho-Heineken Prize for Cognitive Science (Q278240) use field of work (P101) and have a constraint violation because field of work (P101) is only applicable to people and organizations.

(The musical content of the 2-LP set is on disc 1 of the 1996 release.) I've taken a shot at clarifying the situation by introducing Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965–1968 (Q54641059) and Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965–1968 (Q54641193).

Mahir256 (talk) 01:35, 2 June 2018 (UTC) (Response deleted entirely for clarity, since it was based on largely inaccurate and outdated information. Jc86035 (1) (talk) 17:00, 2 June 2018 (UTC)) See also Wikidata:Project chat/Archive/2018/02#Property:P2291, and other questions about music, which no one responded to. Jc86035 (1) (talk) 08:32, 2 June 2018 (UTC) @Jmabel: (Response edited for clarity.) For that album specifically, I haven't looked at most of the properties (though the dates should ideally be accurate to the day); if the album was only released in those two formats the item structure should be fine. \"Has part\" with four CDs is somewhat questionable nowadays, since many older albums are now available for streaming or digital download: one Nuggets edition has an entry on last.fm (Q183718) (although I don't know how last.fm works so I don't know if it's relevant). Jc86035 (1) (talk) 10:07, 2 June 2018 (UTC) When things are decently documented in a WikiProject, the main thing we need in Help:Modelling is just a link. - Jmabel (talk) 05:45, 2 June 2018 (UTC) Possibly helpful for you to read up on Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records, Jc86035 (1), maybe via Wikidata:WikiProject Books. The concept gets a nod at Wikidata:WikiProject Music and is the approach Jmabel followed. --Tagishsimon (talk) 10:01, 2 June 2018 (UTC) Actually, because I have some time and @Jc86035 (1): response is really annoying me ... first, this is not some new undiscovered territory. Starting with \"I'll assume there is currently no set system for modelling musical releases\" reassures us that you have not read, or have not understood, the work done on wikidata and elsewhere. It does not auger well for the rest of your screed. You continue \"because everything I've found so far is just the Wikipedia model of sticking everything related into one item\". Which is odd, because even a cursory reading of Wikidata:WikiProject Music makes clear the distinction between the work/expression and the manifestation (in FRBR terms); and it is the work / manifestation pattern which is being discussed here. You then proceed into a long repetitive list of what you perhaps imagine are edge-cases. Most can be answered fairly easily whether or not you adopt the FRBR approach, by asking whether the edition/variant/release is notable in wikidata terms, or structurally useful. I agree with you that your Never Gonna Give You Up example is stupid. I note you next veer off on a hobby-horse about notability - which though interesting, relevant and debatable, has nothing at all to do with data modelling. Together, the edge cases and notability stuff look more like flinging mud around because you have nothing meaningful to say on the modelling question. Your second answer is a miniature repeat of the first; a long list of factors on which you state the model might depend, without bothering to make any explanation as to how any of these factors might affect the model - full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. And the reason I'm annoyed is that we are no wiser at the end of your long screed than we were at the start; we've merely had our time wasted. --Tagishsimon (talk) 16:02, 2 June 2018 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: I'd like to apologise for writing what is apparently a load of nonsense. I was not aware that the FRBR could be applied to musical works; and in the February discussion linked absolutely no one responded so I assumed that much of the data model was incomplete, especially in regards to chart positions, the classification of editions of works, and what qualifies as an edition of a work. I have deleted my comment for now, save for the link to the February discussion which I hope was written more coherently in your view.

Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 14:34, 2 June 2018 (UTC) Right, and I don't think there is a reason to model every edition of everything.

Ahoerstemeier (talk) 13:30, 4 June 2018 (UTC) GEOnet Names is riddled with errors. Abductive (talk) 16:07, 4 June 2018 (UTC) And exactly the same errors (and more) are present in geonames. Some are curated by the Wiki approach within geonames, but others added. The only advantage of geonames over GEOnet - its possible to link to an item in geonames.

If you preface the term with \"P:\" (eg. \"P:choreographer\") and hit the \"containing\" link at the bottom, you'll do a search of properties. Autocomplete for properties is available when you add a statement of course. ArthurPSmith (talk) 19:36, 4 June 2018 (UTC) Why on earth doesn't our search include properties by default? Or have a more obvious way to include them? - Jmabel (talk) 00:30, 5 June 2018 (UTC) The search results include Main items and Properties. choreographer (P1809) is the 3rd result.[5] However, the autocomplete in the search box only gives Main items. I have no idea why they differ. Ghouston (talk) 01:52, 5 June 2018 (UTC) Got it.

Presumably some of those click the button in the sidebar leading to the Wikidata item and then press random buttons to figure out how to change their settings, either by typing in their preferred language into the box or by typing in things like \"opt-out\", in an attempt to change the settings. (The fonts settings box itself should probably link to a more informative page than it does now, imo.) --Yair rand (talk) 05:36, 5 June 2018 (UTC) Association football team season I think is an unnecessary to use association football team season (Q26887310) with instance of (P31). It's better to use sports season of a sports club (Q1539532) with instance of (P31) and sport (P641) with association football (Q2736). Xaris333 (talk) 11:19, 5 June 2018 (UTC) Some background for all editors: according to current setup, we have around 70.000 items of the type sports season of a sports club (Q1539532) (example: 2012–13 FC Bayern Munich season (Q3755332)). For quite a while they have been mostly ignored by Wikidatians, until we recently equipped a substantial fraction of 58k of them with with season of club or team (P5138) (it is a bit more difficult for the remaining ones). During that process, we found that there was a mixture of different models used with instance of (P31), just as you describe: either instance of (P31): sports season of a sports club (Q1539532) with an additional sport (P641), or alternatively a subclass of sports season of a sports club (Q1539532) by type of sport for values of instance of (P31) (with an additional, somewhat redundant sport (P641) claim). During the setup of season of club or team (P5138) values, the instance of (P31) values have been harmonized to the more specific values as well. Up-to-date statistics of these uses were compiled by @Jura1 at Property talk:P5138#Charts. Now technically it should not really matter which model we choose here, as none of them has serious drawbacks or advantages. To my opinion the current model is a tiny bit more favorable due to the fact that we do indeed talk about a large amount of items here which justifies using the subclasses as values, and because the sport (P641) property has effectivly a bad definition which makes it pretty impossible to maintain its use—one basically cannot really rely on it. —MisterSynergy (talk) 11:49, 5 June 2018 (UTC) Again the big problem of Wikidata shows up. We don't have manuals for users how to do items of the same subjects. We have different opinions and every time we don't agree. That's why there is a mess. This is a serious reason for someone not to contribute to Wikidata... Xaris333 (talk) 15:01, 5 June 2018 (UTC) This part of Wikidata is just about to be developed. As I said, we haven’t really done much work here yet, so there was nothing to document. Another important property for this field, sports competition competed at (P5249), was just created today. It would indeed be useful to write documentation about this part of the knowledge tree once this is in a better condition. If we find that a somewhat different model would be clearly preferable, we can simply change to it with little effort. —MisterSynergy (talk) 18:18, 5 June 2018 (UTC) If we decide to talk about all the fields (starting from the main ones like sport teams), we could solve many problems and have the documentations. If we had had those discussions before, we may had created sports competition competed at (P5249) in the past... An of course we can change anything in the future... Now, we are just discussing some problems sporadically here or in other pages. And every user is doing what ever he think/know. We don't have something general to guide us.Xaris333 (talk) 19:23, 5 June 2018 (UTC) RfC: Plans to graduate the New Filters on Watchlist out of beta Collaboration team is announcing plans to graduate the New Filters for Edit Review out of beta on Watchlist by late June or early July. After launch, this suite of improved edit-search tools will be standard on all wikis. Individuals who prefer the existing Watchlist interface will be able to opt out by means of a new preference.The New Filters introduce an easier yet more powerful user interface to Watchlist as well as a whole list of filters and other tools that make reviewing edits more efficient, including live page updating, user-defined highlighting,the ability to create special-purpose filter sets and save them for re-use and (on wikis with ORES enabled) predictive filters powered by machine learning. If you’re not familiar with the New Filters, please give them a try on Watchlist by activating the New Filters beta feature. In particular, it would be very helpful if you can test the new functionality with your local gadgets and configurations. The documentation pages provide guidance on how to use the many new tools you’ll discover.Over 70,000 people have activated the New Filters beta, which has been in testing on Watchlist for more than eight months. We feel confident that the features are stable and effective, but if you have thoughts about these tools or the beta graduation, please let us know on the project talk page. In particular, tell us if you know of a special incompatibility or other issue that makes the New Filters problematic on your wiki. We’ll examine the blocker and may delay release on your wiki until the issue can be addressed. - -Kaartic (talk) 17:14, 5 June 2018 (UTC) Let me know if there's a better place to post this. - -Kaartic (talk) 17:15, 5 June 2018 (UTC) Source of error by bot I found these erroneous coordinates entered by KrBot to Strombolicchio (Q1189187) and claimed to be sourced to the Russian Wikipedia. At the time the bot make the entry, the Russian Wikipedia had correct coordinates. Now I wonder, how could a \"bot\" make such an incorrect entry? Are all the coordinates entered by this bot false? How is the integrity of Wikidata data protected? Abductive (talk) 05:04, 2 June 2018 (UTC) Looks like they stem from here, which was the current ruwiki version at that time. —MisterSynergy (talk) 05:23, 2 June 2018 (UTC) So, how could they get corrected in the source, but not on Wikidata? Is there really absolutely nothing ensuring the integrity of the data on Wikidata? Abductive (talk) 06:06, 2 June 2018 (UTC) What do you suggest? --- Jura 07:10, 2 June 2018 (UTC) Just an idea: stop using bot to import data from WP ? Snipre (talk) 08:02, 2 June 2018 (UTC) So, that means people will generate transcription error (Q7833925)s instead of dumb bot errors? No, there needs to be some sort of concerted database reconciliation. Abductive (talk) 19:07, 2 June 2018 (UTC) Wrong, because contributors often do what bots never do: they check the data before adding them to WD and even sometimes they add some references. One of the advantages of humans, they contribute in field of interest and have a better knowledge helping to detect error. Snipre (talk) 20:26, 2 June 2018 (UTC) Transcription errors are a well-studied topic, and I assure that they occur any time a person uses a keyboard to enter data. \"The SE error rates can be quite variable, and have been reported to be as low as 10.8^8 and as high as 124 per 10,000 fields. In one study where two SE datasets were created from the same data, 6.5% of the entered fields did not match in the two datasets. This translates to an error rate of 650 per 10,000 fields. In a study where two professional data managers conducted SE and consistency checks, error rates were lower, at 13 and 15 errors per 10,000 fields, the lower rates being attributed to the addition of consistency checks. Although there are few studies on DE, one study compared DE and SE and found that DE reduced the error rate from 22 to 19 per 10,000 fields.\" from Reducing errors from the electronic transcription of data collected on paper forms: a research data case study (Q31148099). Abductive (talk) 21:20, 2 June 2018 (UTC) So what's your point. How could we avoid this kind of \"error\"? --Succu (talk) 21:24, 2 June 2018 (UTC) \"Never send a human to do a machine's job.\" Jheald (talk) 21:28, 2 June 2018 (UTC) Not sure what kind of help is citing a book title here to move on... --Succu (talk) 21:39, 2 June 2018 (UTC) Interesting to see it reused, but really the phrase needs Hugo Weaving's characteristic intonation. Jheald (talk) 07:42, 3 June 2018 (UTC) The article says DE (double entry) and consistency checking reduces errors. Abductive (talk) 22:49, 2 June 2018 (UTC) (ec) Have you any evidence to support your assertions, Snipre? Or is it enough to wave away transcription errors & users who do not conduct further checks; and instead hail the model contributor as a paradigm? Any stats on the volume of data imported by bots from wikipedias and the source error rate? Any figures on contributor data error rates? Any info on algorithmic error detection versus human error detection, perhaps in terms of scale and accuracy? Or are we just doing opinion and anecdote now? In the instant case, the bot correctly referenced the source, in effect making no greater claims than that that wikipedia claimed those coordinates at that time; and leaving a means by which users could ascertain the credentials of the source. To be sure, it is always regrettable when bad data is entered into wikidata; still, I remain unconvinced by your uncompelling proposal to dispose of bathwater & baby. Abductive's proposal seems much nearer the mark, and such reconciliation is conducted, in all sorts of ways, on all sorts of subsets of wikidata, to the limit of our combined skill, interest, time, and availability of yardsticks. I think we're all clear on the need for this to continue, increase & widen in scope. Equally the shock horror of finding a single duff coordinate arriving in wikipedia as the result of a bot action is possibly an insufficient trigger for a clarion call for 'some sort of concerted database reconciliation', but rather business as usual. --Tagishsimon (talk) 21:40, 2 June 2018 (UTC) I have been finding a very high percentage of errors in coordinates on Wikipedia, and when I come to Wikidata to correct them here, I find even more errors. Abductive (talk) 22:46, 2 June 2018 (UTC) ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ So what kind of consistency checks and/or concerted database reconciliation do you suggest for coordinates? (Not sure if \"double entry\" would work here). --- Jura 13:35, 3 June 2018 (UTC) I will happily volunteer to fix any inconsistencies. Perhaps a bot could generate a list of those coordinates that don't match their Wikipedia citation by more than 1 2 arcseconds and post it somewhere? Abductive (talk) 03:08, 4 June 2018 (UTC) Btw, I found another error in coordinates cited to the Russian Wikipedia by KrBot while looking up Volcán de Fuego (Q859376) because it erupted today. I am not actively looking for activity by KrBot, but I think it would be nice if somebody could. Abductive (talk) 06:26, 4 June 2018 (UTC) It's just that ruwiki updated the coordinates since the import 5 years ago: https://ru.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%A4%D1%83%D1%8D%D0%B3%D0%BE&diff=93067753&oldid=58960694 --- Jura 06:53, 4 June 2018 (UTC) Once data is imported from Wikipedia, we generally don't check if it was updated there. Ideally wikis would eventually use directly data from here. For coordinates, I think Wikipedias could easily stop storing them locally and replace them with those from Wikidata. Commons coordinates templates have an option that compares them with Wikidata's. Maybe the same could be done for ruwiki: see the Commons sitelink on Q15961075. --- Jura 06:53, 4 June 2018 (UTC) Of course things would be easier for Wikidata if every other WMF project used Wikidata this way, but until someone comes up with a way that will be easy for people editing the articles in question, it won't have much appeal for contributors whose main focus is something other than Wikidata. Which is to say: if neither of the two normal ways of editing Wikipedia -- editing wikitext and using the WYSIWYG editor -- makes it easy to edit content drawn from Wikidata, it's no wonder that Wikipedians find that an unappealing process to make corrections. Parallel issues for Commons & others as users of data. - Jmabel (talk) 00:29, 5 June 2018 (UTC) Somehow I doubt adding coordinates directly in Wikipedia is easier than just adding a P625 in Wikidata. This isn't necessarily true for other properties. --- Jura 19:38, 5 June 2018 (UTC) Adding the coordinates themselves are about the same level of difficulty regardless of whether it's Wikidata or Wikipedia. But adding the citation to the source is much more difficult in Wikidata, because one (potentially) has to search to see if the work, edition, article, authors, etc., already exist, and if not, add them, before you can actually add the citation. Jc3s5h (talk) 21:05, 5 June 2018 (UTC) Not sure about that. Wikidata has a GUI for coordinates. It might be possible to develop a way to replace coordinates in Wikipedia with those at Wikidata. --- Jura 13:06, 6 June 2018 (UTC) Introducing Toolhub What does your participation on the Wikimedia projects look like? Do you edit articles? Upload files? Patrol vandalism? Translate articles? Translate interface messages? Do you organize people, online or offline? Do you train new editors, or new trainers? Do you write code?There are many different ways to contribute to Wikimedia – more than you would expect just from reading Wikipedia articles. Over the past several years, volunteers have developed technical tools that help Wikimedians improve content, patrol vandalism, and perform many other tasks. They make it possible to do what the wiki software alone cannot accomplish. Without these tools, many of our projects would slow down to a crawl.I am very happy to announce a new project called Toolhub which seeks to create a searchable index of these tools in all languages. We are building this tool catalog based on what our communities need. If you would like to help, please take a look at m:Toolhub and review the question at the top of the page. You can also leave feedback in any language on the talkpage. You can also email me private feedback. Harej (WMF) (talk) 23:30, 2 June 2018 (UTC) Why not do this in Wikidata?

Amazing how much data it involves when one goes all the way back. Maybe from a data quality point of view, it would be good to have a secondary source for recent data. There is some risk involved relying merely on tertiary sources outside WMF. How accessible is the current data model for new users? --- Jura 08:04, 4 June 2018 (UTC) @Jura: Recent data (~1997-date) is generally drawn from the MySociety database, not-quite-so-recent data (1832-1997) from Historic Hansard (though that needs a *lot* of manual cleanup work). The official parliamentary MNIS database has recently become accessible and I'm hoping to get our data aligned with that as well, which will probably get us back to sometime in the nineties. So that will give us a nice mix of recent primary + secondary. From a reliablity perspective, pne of the things I'm working on is some way to take simple static snapshots of the cleaned data and make it available somewhere so that people don't have to tangle with Wikidata to make sense of it if all they need is an authority list of names and dates - we could then run periodic updates but it could be clearly versioned and static. We ran a workshop with non-Wikidata people at the Welsh Assembly last year (focusing on Welsh politicians, obv) and I was pleasantly surprised by how accessible they found the data model. When I've discussed the data model with (non-Wikidata but political data) specialists, they've generally felt it's robust and clear, with a few questions around specific details like how we define start dates (there are about six possible options and no-one quite agrees on what one to go for; we picked the simplest!) Andrew Gray (talk) 19:30, 6 June 2018 (UTC) Username policy The template {{uw-username}} refers to \"Wikidata's username policy\". Do we have a username policy? Lambiam (talk) 21:08, 4 June 2018 (UTC) I don’t know of any and there is none in Category:Wikidata policies. However, there is Wikidata:Use common sense as a fallback :-) —MisterSynergy (talk) 21:14, 4 June 2018 (UTC) The English-language Wikipedia's is at en:Wikipedia:Username policy - the core difference between that and Wikidata's current practice is the former's prohibition of corporate accounts (which are also allowed on some other Wikipedias, and on Wikimedia Commons - see c:Commons:Username_policy). It would be sensible to adopt the prohibition of misleading, disruptive, offensive or non-script usernames from that document. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 22:03, 4 June 2018 (UTC) Because of global accounts it would in fact make sense to have a unified username policy across the Wikimedia projects, but that may be an unrealistic aim. Apparently we (or at least some Wikidatans) also have a problem with corporate accounts; see User talk:Zetaespacial. (The account is blocked on the English Wikipedia, but not on its Spanish sister project or elsewhere.) I do not care which username policy exactly is adopted as long as it creates no impediment to good-faith contributors, but I think we should not refer to \"Wikidata's username policy\" if we don't have any. Lambiam (talk) 23:57, 4 June 2018 (UTC) I don't see any problem with that account. We have valuble contributors that use names that would be forbidden by EnWiki standards and I'm not aware of any problems we encountered with users who have such names.

Mike Peel (talk) 00:46, 7 June 2018 (UTC) Maybe service entry (P729) / service retirement (P730), they list vehicle model (Q29048322) as an acceptable usage. But perhaps service retirement (P730) doesn't apply until the last one is taken off the road. Otherwise, there's the all-purpose inception (P571) / dissolved, abolished or demolished date (P576), and also discontinued date (P2669) which is very appropriate but doesn't have an opposite. Perhaps it should be service entry (P729) / discontinued date (P2669).

I mean that the first teams qualifies to Champions League, that is the event that the best teams of the league qualifies to. So I suggest that ⟨ 2017–18 La Liga (Q24529775)    ⟩ qualifies for event (P3085) ⟨ 2018–19 UEFA Champions League (Q30032467)    ⟩ series ordinal (P1545) ⟨ 1 ⟩ and ⟨ 2017–18 La Liga (Q24529775)    ⟩ qualifies for event (P3085) ⟨ 2018–19 UEFA Europa League (Q30126418)    ⟩ series ordinal (P1545) ⟨ 2 ⟩ Or something else, if someone has an idea.And, I suggest to use P1545 even if the event qualifies only for one event.

Please help translate to your language! Thank you. In short: starting on June 18, New Filters for Edit Review (now in Beta) will become standard on Watchlists. They provide an array of new tools and an improved interface. If you prefer the current page you will be able to opt out. Learn more about the New Filters. What is this feature again? This feature is used by default on Special:RecentChanges, Special:RecentChangesLinked and as a Beta feature on Special:Watchlist. Based on a new design, that feature adds new functions to those pages, to ease vandalism tracking and support of newcomers: Filtering - filter recent changes with easy-to-use and powerful filters combinations, including filtering by namespace or tagged edits. Highlighting - add a colored background to the different changes you are monitoring. It helps quick identification of changes that matter to you. Bookmarking to keep your favorite configurations of filters ready to be used. Quality and Intent Filters - those filters use ORES predictions. They identify real vandalism or good faith intent contributions that need help. They are not available on all wikis. You can know more about this project by visiting the quick tour help page. About the release on Watchlists Over 70,000 people have activated the New Filters beta, which has been in testing on Watchlist for more than eight months. We feel confident that the features are stable and effective, but if you have thoughts about these tools or the beta graduation, please let us know on the project talk page. In particular, tell us if you know of a special incompatibility or other issue that makes the New Filters problematic on your wiki. We’ll examine the blocker and may delay release on your wiki until the issue can be addressed. The deployment will start on June 18 or on June 25, depending on the wiki (check the list). After the deployment, you will also be able to opt-out this change directly from the Watchlist page and also in your preferences. How to be ready? Please share this announcement! If you use local Gadgets that change things on your Watchlist pages, or have a customized scripts or CSS, be ready. You may have to make some changes to your configuration. Despite the fact that we have tried to take most cases into consideration, some configurations may break. The Beta phase is a great opportunity to have a look at local scripts and gadgets: some of them may be replaced by native features from the Beta feature. Please share your questions and comments on the feedback page.

Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 14:57, 7 June 2018 (UTC) Bad parameters: format as a regular expression Hello,I'm wondering how \"format as a regular expression\" (P1793) must be used in the right way.I follow the documentation available at https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:Property_constraints_portal/FormatHowever, every time I use the constraint report there is at least one \"Bad parameters: format as a regular expression\" line.E.g. https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ConstraintReport/P18Is this an issue with constraint report?Best, Peter – The preceding unsigned comment was added by 85.183.145.212 (talk • contribs) at 16:00, 7 June 2018‎ (UTC). Not sure if that actually works. It's the constraint defined on Property:P1793. Maybe it's more worthwhile to check if the constraint for a specific property (e.g. P18) work on an item using that property (an image somewhere). The querry on the format constraint at Property talk:P18 can help you with that. --- Jura 16:17, 7 June 2018 (UTC) @85.183.145.212, Jura1: Yes, it’s due to the format constraint placed on the property format as a regular expression (P1793) itself: it attempts to detect valid regular expressions, using a regular expression. This is not, generally, something that you can do with regular expressions; as the StackOverflow answer that this was copied from (not a CC0 source, by the way!) notes, that regular expression works in PCRE-based regex engines, but as documented on Help:Property constraints portal/Format, the WikibaseQualityConstraints extension, which powers Special:ConstraintReport, uses a different regex flavor. --Lucas Werkmeister (WMDE) (talk) 16:35, 7 June 2018 (UTC) Pantheon Not sure how best to tease this apart. I sampled some of the Wikipedia articles in various languages, and they appear all to be about a \"pantheon\" in the sense of the collection of gods of a particular religion or mythos. (Ironically, given that the etymology of the word is Greek, no article in Greek.) However, the linked Commons:Category:Pantheons is relates to the literal Greek meaning of Πάνθεον, a temple of all of the gods (of a particular religion or mythos). And, equally oddly, while we have many Wikipedia articles on pantheons in the latter sense, I don't offhand see where any Wikipedia has an article on the concept of pantheons in that sense, in general.It presume that at the very least the Commons category should be decoupled from the Wikipedia articles that are about a different (albeit related) concept, maybe connected by a different from (P1889). May I assume that we also should create another category for the concept in the Commons category? Also, I would imagine that the latter should be a class, and the various buildings of that sort that have items should be instances of that class. - 04:54, 5 June 2018 (UTC) Looking at en:Pantheon, and the Commons category, the buildings don't seem to make up a class of ancient Roman temples. The Commons category seems to be nothing more than a group of buildings that have \"Pantheon\" in their name. Ghouston (talk) 05:38, 5 June 2018 (UTC) So perhaps we have three things? A pantheon in the abstract sense covered by these Wikipedia articles. A slightly dubious Commons category Commons:Category:Pantheons which possibly should be renamed as Commons:Category:Buildings called \"Pantheon\" Ancient Roman Pantheons (which probably should have Wikipedia articles and a Commons Category, but currently don't). - Jmabel (talk) 04:36, 6 June 2018 (UTC) Lacking further response, that is what I will do. - Jmabel (talk) 21:19, 7 June 2018 (UTC) I now see Wikidata really doesn't have items/classes like 'buildings called \"Pantheon\"'. So what should I do with that Commons category? - Jmabel (talk) 21:28, 7 June 2018 (UTC) I think there must be quite a few Commons categories that can't be connected to Wikidata, because there are no corresponding categories in other projects for them to link with (so no need for a Category item), and a somewhat obscure concept behind the category which isn't really appropriate for a main item. c:Category:Automobiles facing left seems like another one. Ghouston (talk) 00:08, 8 June 2018 (UTC) Entering a label in a language I don't normally use I've forgotten (and can't work out) where to configure what languages I use for labels. I would like to enter a label in a language I don't ordinarily use. Is there a way to do this without changing my preferences? Where do I go to change the preference of which languages are offered to me to enter labels? Is there somewhere I should have been able to find this in documentation? Jmabel (talk) 21:59, 7 June 2018 (UTC) @Jmabel: If you adjust the languages in your Babel boxes, you can control what languages you can edit labels/descriptions/aliases in without going to \"Labels list\". Mahir256 (talk) 00:40, 8 June 2018 (UTC) Ah, I didn't know about \"Labels list\". - Jmabel (talk) 02:49, 8 June 2018 (UTC) Help:Modelling As I've been trying to turn Help:Modelling into something useful, I seem now to have hit the limit for template inclusions. Is there any way to override that? (I'm guessing not.) If not, would there be any problem with my splitting the page into two, one for \"General\" and the other for \"By domains\"? Also open to other suggestions. - Jmabel (talk) 03:35, 8 June 2018 (UTC) @Jmabel: I am sure no one would object to a reasonable division of the page into subpages which are linked from the main page. Keeping all of it in one place seems rather unwieldy. Mahir256 (talk) 04:10, 8 June 2018 (UTC) OK. If I make it look like tabs, it would be very little impact to anyone, I think. - Jmabel (talk) 04:12, 8 June 2018 (UTC) @Jmabel: It may be better if they are separate subpages entirely (unless you're talking about presenting the subpages like the tabs on this page). If everything is on one page, and even if only one 'tab' is visible, the rest of the page gets loaded into the web browser and could slow it down. Mahir256 (talk) 04:29, 8 June 2018 (UTC) @Mahir256: Yes, physically separate pages. I've already done it, though I have to look through and see if I may have gotten any links messed up. - Jmabel (talk) 04:31, 8 June 2018 (UTC) You can look for values of a statement in Special:Search Hello all,A few days ago, the discovery team from WMF introduced a new magic word to search for string values and external identifiers values: haswbstatement. Here are a few examples on how it works: haswbstatement:P1015=90196888 for the value of an external ID haswbstatement:\"P373=Douglas Adams\" for a string value haswbstatement:P31=Q13442814 for a value that is an item (note that you have to use the Qid, it doesn't work with labels) To search for items that do not have a certain statement, add an “exclude” modifier, for example -haswbstatement:P31=Q13442814. The feature is documented here. If you have any question, feel free to ask in the ticket. Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 13:40, 29 May 2018 (UTC) Wow! This is some replacement for Queries! --Infovarius (talk) 08:27, 30 May 2018 (UTC) I added a search box to property talk pages for strings and identifiers (e.g. Property talk:P214). It might make it easier to input the syntax. --- Jura 09:36, 30 May 2018 (UTC) The ticket seems to be about strings and external identifiers. Is the item version meant to work just for P31 or also for other properites? Special:Search/haswbstatement:P641=Q3548048 doesn't seem to work despite there being some 250: https://query.wikidata.org/#SELECT%2a%7B%3Fitem%20wdt%3AP641%20wd%3AQ3548048%7D Maybe this explains why Special:Search/John -haswbstatement:P735=Q4925477 and Special:Search/John haswbstatement:P31=Q5 -haswbstatement:P735=Q4925477 don't work either. --- Jura 13:33, 30 May 2018 (UTC) @Lea Lacroix (WMDE): In your announcement, the documentation and the phab-ticket it sounds like haswbstatement would work for every pair of P…=Q… but as Jura pointed out, it seems only to work with P31. Is this a bug in the feature or a not documented but known limitation of the feature? -- MichaelSchoenitzer (talk) 00:00, 5 June 2018 (UTC) @Lea Lacroix (WMDE): I just saw this through today's weekly summary. It's a good step forward, but most people are just going to want to search for something like \"nhle 1221685\" and expect to end up at Lovell Telescope (Q555130), if they are even going to include the identifier acronym rather than just copy-pasting the ID value. They aren't going to look for something as obscure as \"haswbstatement\". It sounds like this will be useful for experienced Wikidata users, but not more widely than that. Thanks. Mike Peel (talk) 02:01, 5 June 2018 (UTC) Hello, and thanks for your feedback. The fact that only P31 and P279 are supported for now is an intentional restriction, mentioned in the main ticket. If you want to request more features, feel free to open a subtask. Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 16:20, 8 June 2018 (UTC) Prosperity? For prosperity and usefulness is this going to be recorded somewhere so that it is not lost? Is it time for Wikidata:Search or would this be better written into Mediawiki:search-summary or some multi-language-templated style that is transcluded into that page? — billinghurst sDrewth 22:09, 5 June 2018 (UTC) Do you mean \"posterity\"? Or do you mean something else and I'm misunderstanding? Can't see what it would have to do with prosperity. - Jmabel (talk) 04:30, 6 June 2018 (UTC) relation between platform (P400) and operating system (P306) @TomT0m, Agabi10: WikiProject Ontology has more than 50 participants and couldn't be pinged. Please post on the WikiProject's talk page instead.I noted previous discussions about the relation between platform (P400) and operating system (P306). It has been proposed to merge the two properties. English Wikipedia article about considers computing platform a broader concept than operating system that encompasses also browsers, apps like Microsoft Excel, virtual machines, PAAS and software frameworks.I think we should: extend the allowed values to these cases; make operating system (P306) a subproperty of platform (P400) create \"browser\" and \"software\" properties (currently Google Chrome (Q777) and Firefox (Q698) are already used 30 times as value of platform (P400)) and make them subproperties of \"platform\". key press (P4998) already uses platform (P400) as qualifier with sofware products as values.--Malore (talk) 17:35, 6 June 2018 (UTC) Support the first two suggested changes. Not sure on a \"browser\" or \"software\" property. ArthurPSmith (talk) 18:17, 6 June 2018 (UTC) Support - PKM (talk) 18:48, 6 June 2018 (UTC) I suggest an alternative of using only platform (P400) when talking about software, and reserving operating system (P306) for hardware. E.g., NEC PC-100 (Q2052495) operating system (P306) MS-DOS (Q47604) and Google Chrome (Q5583814) platform (P400) Android (Q94). I don't see the advantage of having subproperties of platform (P400), since you can examine the target to see what kind of thing it is. Ghouston (talk) 03:51, 7 June 2018 (UTC) Support I think your proposal is better than my last two points.--Malore (talk) 00:08, 8 June 2018 (UTC) Currently, I removed the \"one-of constraint\" and I added  v t e property constraint value-type constraint edit class computing platform relation instance of 0 references add reference add value--Malore (talk) 17:03, 8 June 2018 (UTC)Imperial University of Dorpat vs. University of Tartu Q28024477 Imperial University of Dorpat (1802-1917) Q204181 University of Tartu Several people are linked to the wrong University, I fixed it for some, e.g. Hermann Guido von Samson-Himmelstjerna (1809-1868) https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q89382&type=revision&diff=692243481&oldid=668243649 Karl Ernst von Baer (1792-1876) https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q57190&diff=prev&oldid=692242377 Everyone that died before 1917 should be moved from University of Tartu to Imperial University of Dorpat. 85.180.59.131 09:57, 8 June 2018 (UTC) University of Tartu (Q204181) incorporates the history back to 1632. Imperial University of Dorpat (Q28024477) is just an alternative name for part of that history. Linking them all to University of Tartu (Q204181) is probably best. Ghouston (talk) 12:13, 8 June 2018 (UTC) Connecting Article to Wikidata Moved from Wikidata talk:Project chat The wikidata can't find the name of the person who has a wiki article. It is a article that was just moved. Anyone help?I can't find the name in the drop down menu – The preceding unsigned comment was added by Ohare415 (talk • contribs) at 9. 6. 2018, 08:04‎ (UTC).

Trying to complete the properties for all places of Limassol District (Q59150), a problem came out. Please see User:Xaris333/LimassolDistrict1. The district have 6 municipalities and 105 communities. The problem is about executive body (P208). I have created separated items for each of municipalities (like Yermasoyia's municipal council (Q54865675)). For communities I just added the general Municipal Councilor in Huy (Q29385989). So, I get the distinct-values constraint (Q21502410) (See Q3561641#P208. I know why I am getting this. My question is that: do I really have to create an item for communal council for each community? Is that necessary? And If yes, is there an easy way to do that? Xaris333 (talk) 13:10, 9 June 2018 (UTC) If it doesn't have a communal council of its own, it seems to me to be counterproductive at add one as a property. - Jmabel (talk) 16:53, 9 June 2018 (UTC) All communities have a communal council (except 2 of them). Xaris333 (talk) 17:05, 9 June 2018 (UTC) One possible way round this: for each of the statements with the generic value Municipal Councilor in Huy (Q29385989), add an of (P642) qualifier with the value of the community in question. Then add separator (P4155) = of (P642) as a qualifier to the distinct-values constraint (Q21502410) constraint on executive body (P208). Jheald (talk) 17:22, 9 June 2018 (UTC) I did what you said but there are still some constrains. Xaris333 (talk) 19:40, 9 June 2018 (UTC) I don't think generic values are valid for executive body (P208). If the value is worth dding the Wikidata way is to create an item for it. If a property like it is filled with general values that violates reasonble expecations of data users. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 20:25, 9 June 2018 (UTC) So I have to create 105 new items? Xaris333 (talk) 21:43, 9 June 2018 (UTC) Yes, creating them via QuickStatements seems the way to go.

Thanks. Xaris333 (talk) 11:00, 11 June 2018 (UTC) Overriding same label/description check There is a check in Wikidata UI that prevents creating items with same label/description in the same language. Which is generally very useful, however there are some cases where it doesn't work very well. E.g. some painters have an annoying habit of reusing painting topics (i.e. same painter can have several portraits of the same person, or several paintings of \"Woman with Dog\"). In this case, I wonder what would be the best way? Provide some way to override the check? Change description/label to add something else (year? location? something else?) What do you think? Laboramus (talk) 23:13, 10 June 2018 (UTC) Do it as done for Edvard Munch (Q41406). Self-Portrait (Q18890787) with description painting by Edvard Munch (1886), and Self-Portrait (Q18890786) with description painting by Edvard Munch (1882 - 2), and Self-Portrait (Q18890789) with painting by Edvard Munch (1940). I think Dates, years, location and paranthesis should not be used in label unless it is clearly a part of the tittle/label. Pmt (talk) 23:30, 10 June 2018 (UTC) @Laboramus: I had the same issue with some monuments and photos I was creating the items. My solution was (once they are from the same artist/photographer, same year, etc, I put \"# of the series\" like here Vista aérea da cidade de São Paulo/SP (Q53140975). I really don't think override the check is a good thing. I suggest, if there are some property that differentiate one from the other, you should go in that way. If there's nothing to differentiate (like in my example), change the description to something like I said \"# of the series\". Good contributions, Ederporto (talk) 02:58, 11 June 2018 (UTC) The items should be individually identifiable using only the label and description, so if you have 3 painting with the same name by the same artist you have to start pulling in extra factors to the description. The most obvious factor is time, and that can fix this issue even if an artist paints 3 works with the same name in a single week. Other factor could also be used, for example if there are 3 works with the same name, each painted in a different way? signed in a different way? different size? Any factor that can distinguish them will work, although the future proof one will probably always be time. ·addshore· talk to me! 07:43, 11 June 2018 (UTC) For undated paintings or painters whose paintings are only approximate, please use the location (church, museum, person who commissioned the work, the last location published for the work, etc) to disambiguate the description, so e.g. title= \"Self-Portrait\" and description= \"painting by XXX (Uffizi)\" vs. \"painting by XXX (Berlin)\" Jane023 (talk) 13:14, 11 June 2018 (UTC) Just to know: It's possible. I done it for problem with upper/lower case in disambiguation items, but it's better minimize use. --ValterVB (talk) 17:47, 11 June 2018 (UTC) As addshore said it's important to make the description more concrete in these cases in order to help other people tell them apart. Otherwise people might not understand they're different paintings and merge them. And it's impossible to tell them apart in item selectors etc. --LydiaPintscher (talk) 18:09, 11 June 2018 (UTC) participant of participant in (P1344)It is a complicated properties for sport teams. See for example APOEL F.C. (Q131378). It has values (seasons) for championship, cup, super cup, uefa cup, champions league, cup winners cup etc. A lot of them, with not a chronological order etc. It's difficult to find something. I think is not the best way to show that. I suggest to have something like that: ⟨ APOEL F.C.

Of course P1264 is not a good solution.

When I try to add \"L01\" to ATC code L01 (Q434099), I get an error: Could not save due to an error:The save has failed. This action has been automatically identified as harmful, and therefore disallowed. If you believe your action was constructive, please inform an administrator of what you were trying to do.

Teester (talk) This section was archived on a request by: Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 21:48, 17 June 2018 (UTC) Commons gallery vs category sitelinks I'm contemplating whether it would be worth having an RFC over whether Commons categories should be given priority over Commons galleries on main item sitelinks, in cases where there is no Category item. Creating a category item just for the Commons category is currently forbidden by Wikidata:Notability. There are Commons categories like c:Category:Flow charts and many taxon items like c:Category:Cordulegaster boltonii which can't be sitelinked to Wikidata because the sitelink is already used by a gallery. It's also possible that Commons category sitelinks would be removed if somebody created a new gallery.I think sitelinks to Commons categories are more important that sitelinks to galleries, since Categories are essentially the main name space on Commons, and have more comprehensive contents. The sitelinks are increasingly used by templates on the Commons categories, which doesn't seem to be so important for galleries. Ghouston (talk) 00:25, 8 June 2018 (UTC) +1. - Jmabel (talk) 02:46, 8 June 2018 (UTC) For reference, there was an RfC in 2013. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 06:13, 8 June 2018 (UTC) I remember that one, and the one in 2015, but neither had a clear outcome, and current practice doesn't encourage (and the notability policy forbids) the creation of category items just so that Commons can have two sitelinks. So it seems in some cases we have to pick which sitelink is preferred. Ghouston (talk) 07:18, 8 June 2018 (UTC) @Ghouston: I'm not sure you're right about the latter. As I understand it, if there is also a Commons gallery, what is recommended at the moment currently is to make a category item here, sitelink the category item to the Commons category, and then to link the two items here together with a category's main topic (P301) / topic's main category (P910) pair of statements. Most of the templates on Commons should be able to navigate that, and be able to pull information for the Commons category page from the main topic item here. No strong view against change, but the present system is workable I think. Jheald (talk) 08:35, 8 June 2018 (UTC) I'm not following the logic of the proposal. If the real world Commons has two features to which an item might be linked - category & gallery - should we not provide the capability to link to the two features rather than perpetuate an arrangement that forces us to ration, prioritise & choose one over the other? Further, should we not take up the opportunity to a) sort out the overlap between a commons sitelink and Commons category (P373) and b) standardise the interface for P373 and topic's main category (P910). --Tagishsimon (talk) Changing Wikidata:Notability would work too. I had the idea there wasn't much enthusiasm for creating category items just to hold a Commons sitelink, but I suppose it's only needed when there's a gallery. The gallery sitelinks seem only marginally useful though. Ghouston (talk) 09:34, 8 June 2018 (UTC) Very easy, long talks again and again. Topic pops up again and again. Create category item (if notability policy stands in the way - change it) Create sitelink to link from category item to Commons Create link from item via property \"main category\" to the category item Delete all \"commons category\" if they duplicate the above 85.180.59.131 10:07, 8 June 2018 (UTC) Pretty much, but Commons category (P373) should absolutely not be removed from the original (non-category) item, because there are many searches that depend on it, especially in exactly this scenario, when the sitelink does not go from that item. Jheald (talk) 11:15, 8 June 2018 (UTC) I think having an RfC on this would be a good step forward. There are several different options (default to commons category as the sitelink being one; mass-create category items being another; have two sitelinks to commons being a third but one that's unpopular with the developers), but there's increasingly more value in sitelinking to the categories rather than the galleries on commons.

I'm hoping someone with more experience here than I can come up with appropriate parent classes. - Jmabel (talk) 00:26, 9 June 2018 (UTC)Jura1 may know better as the item creator, but it looks to me like the item arises out of language wikis having Category:Individual aircraft (Q7405461) and Q21051516 being required to express the category's main topic. I would advise against using it as a P31 value, and instead use ⟨ C5-FBS (Q21077767)    ⟩ instance of (P31) ⟨ aircraft (Q11436)    ⟩ or, in fact leave it at just . I would be uninclined to change Q21051516. --Tagishsimon (talk) 00:43, 9 June 2018 (UTC) Interesting. I don't see any cases of an individual aircraft having ⟨ FOO ⟩ instance of (P31) ⟨ aircraft (Q11436)    ⟩ (and there are only a handful with ⟨ FOO ⟩ instance of (P31) ⟨ aircraft (Q21051516)    ⟩ ); also, it looks like using Q11436 just pushes the issue back a step: ⟨ aircraft (Q11436)    ⟩ instance of (P31) ⟨ 22302160 ⟩ , but Q22302160 isn't a class, either! So your ⟨ C5-FBS (Q21077767)    ⟩ instance of (P31) ⟨ Boeing 747-100 (Q9384384)    ⟩ suggestion looks like the most reasonable. - Jmabel (talk) 01:07, 9 June 2018 (UTC) Not sure if I'd do it the same way today. I think it was a general problem with vehicles and other mass produced objects. As P31=aircraft are mostly instances of \"aircraft model\", it seems it still is. It does seem helpful to have a P31 value other than the model. If you are merely concerned about the warnings, you could just change the P31 on Q21051516 to P279. Avoiding Q11436 probably saves you many problems. --- Jura 04:38, 9 June 2018 (UTC) Since this is one of the examples at Help:Modelling/By domains#Aircraft (I didn't add it, I just fleshed it out), it would behoove us to get it right, whatever right is. I'm pretty new here myself. I'm trying to update & flesh out Help:Modelling to accurately describe current practice, since until I started working on it, it had hardly been touched in years. This is a case where, rather than suggestions, I'd really appreciate if someone who knows Wikidata better than I makes the actual decisions, and I merely document the outcome. - Jmabel (talk) 16:50, 9 June 2018 (UTC) Where I have found them different I have systematically made aircraft models like Boeing 747-100 (Q9384384) subclass of (P279) (possibly via intermediate classes) aircraft (Q11436), so that an individual physical aircraft should always be logically an instance of its model. Boeing 747-100 (Q9384384) and similar would also be instance of (P31) aircraft model (Q15056995). Aircraft models are classes, \"aircraft model\" is a metaclass; this all fits together quite consistently. ArthurPSmith (talk) 22:45, 9 June 2018 (UTC) At the risk of repeating myself, I'd really appreciate if someone who knows Wikidata better than I makes the actual decisions, and I merely document the outcome. - Jmabel (talk) 04:20, 10 June 2018 (UTC) I see someone simply removed the statement ⟨ C5-FBS (Q21077767)    ⟩ instance of (P31) ⟨ aircraft (Q11436)    ⟩ , which is fine with me, and removes my issue of a \"bad\" item being given as a paradigm, but still leaves me at a loss in one respect: what, then, is aircraft (Q21051516) about and how is it to be used? - Jmabel (talk) 04:32, 10 June 2018 (UTC) I'm not sure if the page you are updating is actually being used. People describe current practices in Wikiprojects. Maybe it's preferable to just cross reference their pages. --- Jura 04:45, 10 June 2018 (UTC) I am trying to turn it into something usable. A lot of it clearly should just be links to WikiProjects where they exist, and that's what I've been doing. However, as far as I can tell there is absolutely no equivalent of Help:Modelling/General and I'm pretty sure that what I've done with it is already about as useful an introduction as there is for someone who is familiar with data modeling but new to Wikidata. (Do you have something better? If so, we need to link it a lot more prominently, because I went looking for something of the sort a month or so ago & sure didn't find it.) And when I say \"about as useful an introduction as there is\" I don't mean it's by any means what is needed. I mean it's a decent start, and I couldn't find anything before that was a decent start. - Jmabel (talk) 17:05, 10 June 2018 (UTC) @Jmabel: The examples at Help:Modelling/By domains#Aircraft seem right as they are now. Josh Baumgartner (talk) 17:17, 11 June 2018 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: I agree that ⟨ C5-FBS (Q21077767)    ⟩ instance of (P31) ⟨ Boeing 747-100 (Q9384384)    ⟩ is the better method. The value should be the most specific subclass of aircraft (Q11436) appropriate.

And then the museum item will be part of (P361) of the building item. Pmt (talk) 00:18, 12 June 2018 (UTC) (EC) In short, IMO, inception should contain the date the building was completed. The start time for the museum could either be represented as a P580 Qualifier of the P31 museum statement (or if a distinction between the museum organisation and the house can be made, then occupant (P466) could be used to specify the museum as tenant and P580 as a PQ of that statement ... and per Pmt the museum organisation could have its own item). --Tagishsimon (talk) I like the idea of start time for the P31 museum statement. - Jmabel (talk) 02:57, 12 June 2018 (UTC) Best is to create a separate item for the building and the museum each, see the discussion at Wikidata talk:WikiProject Museums#Museum as organization vs. Museum as location. @Pmt: Indeed I think they should preferably be linked using occupant (P466) as Tagishsimon said, not part of (P361). --Marsupium (talk) 12:27, 12 June 2018 (UTC) I think the discussion there makes sense in the case where a museum just happens to be housed in an historic building -- e.g. where a former palace is used as a art museum, or a former main post office as a history museum -- but less in a case like this, a \"house museum,\" where the sole exhibits are the building itself and its furnishings. - Jmabel (talk) 15:33, 12 June 2018 (UTC) Constraint that countries have to belong to a country themselves Right now all objects in Ireland, i.e. those objects which use Property:P17 to put an object into Ireland violate a constraint which expects all countries to belong to a country themselves. This appears in most cases (as in Ireland) a reference to itself where a country is also a sovereign state. This constraint was apparently discussed some time ago in 2013 and subsequently implemented (see relevant edit for Ireland). This edit was recently undone by Oursana. When I reverted this with reference to the previous discussion, Oursana removed it again.I am not very familiar with Wikidata and I am quite indifferent to the question whether sovereign countries should be put into themselves or not. However, I would be grateful if geographical entities can be declared to be within Ireland without violating a constraint. Currently, you will get a constraint warning for all things Irish which refers to Property:P17#P2302 and states Ireland should have a statement country. Thanks, AFBorchert (talk) 05:22, 12 June 2018 (UTC) It was also discussed and reaffirmed recently here Property_talk:P17#Should_countries_have_a_country?_(i.e._self_reference). --99of9 (talk) 06:20, 12 June 2018 (UTC) I only see a discussion, no affirmation. It is still a constraint violation Wikidata:Database reports/Constraint violations/P17#\"Self link\" violations, which I wanted to solve. @[[User:User:AFBorchert|User:AFBorchert]]: Don't you think as unexperienced data-user it wouldn't have been a better idea to discuss before revert? --Oursana (talk) 12:52, 12 June 2018 (UTC) As elaborated above, my revert was based on a previous discussion that led to a consensus which was recently re-affirmed (see post by 99of9). I have refered to this discussion and wouldn't have reverted it unless I wouldn't have found it. Anyway, I do not think that it is helpful to replace one inconsistency by another. And at the moment we have one with Ireland (but not with other countries like Germany (Q183)). If this self-reference is to be undone it should be done IMHO on base of a new discussion. A removal of the self-references would have to be done by bot as well and should surely not be executed without removing the associated requirement first. --AFBorchert (talk) 15:23, 12 June 2018 (UTC) Notability question We have a class Jewish museum (Q1307560) because there is an analogous article in de-wiki. We have an item Category:African-American museums (Q8225342) because Commons has such a category. Do I understand correctly that I am not supposed to create a class item analogous to Q1307560 for the underlying topic of Q8225342 until someone sees fit to write an article in one of the Wikipedias about African-American museums in general? - Jmabel (talk) 05:34, 12 June 2018 (UTC) No. In Wikidata we have multiple ways in which an item can be noteable. Creating a \"African-American museum\" item to link with Category:African-American museums (Q8225342) would mean creating the item for a structual need. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 08:18, 12 June 2018 (UTC) Thanks, I will probably do that, then. - Jmabel (talk) 15:35, 12 June 2018 (UTC) Multilingual Wikisource link?

Mahagaja (talk) 09:21, 12 June 2018 (UTC) The wiki ID is sourceswiki according to the list. Nevertheless the system still does not allow the addition. --Kostas20142 (talk) 11:45, 12 June 2018 (UTC) @Mahagaja, Kostas20142: Umm, somewhat hard, see phab:T54971, there's a proposed FIXME way that tries to unbreak the \"one link per one site entry\" limitation for 3 test-projects wikis. --Liuxinyu970226 (talk) 12:34, 12 June 2018 (UTC) Bird merge?

I'm pretty sure new items need to be created. Joint Base Lewis-McChord is a U.S. military installation that is an amalgamation of the United States Army's Fort Lewis and the United States Air Force's McChord Air Force Base. Our description of it as an instance of airport (Q1248784) apply only to the last, and it looks like the article in various languages may be about any of the three entities. Also, I'd be a bit suspicious of everywhere it's been used as a property value. - Jmabel (talk) 15:46, 12 June 2018 (UTC) We also seem to have Fort Lewis (Q3505731) as a census-designated place in the United States (Q498162) with no reference to it being a military base, McChord Field (Q49356949) sitelinked only to ceb:McChord Air Force Base and with no instance of (P31), and McChord Field (Q1520213). None of these things seem to have any statements connecting them. - Jmabel (talk) 15:51, 12 June 2018 (UTC) I have added instance of (P31), part of (P361) and has part(s) (P527) links between the four. Some double-checking of sitelinks is warranted to make sure they are articles about the correct portion or the whole. Josh Baumgartner (talk) 16:11, 12 June 2018 (UTC) Trying to get {{Ping project}} to work I've been trying to get {{Ping project}} to work for Wikidata:WikiProject_Source_MetaData, to post on the discussion at Wikidata:Property proposal/subject facetI've tried splitting the list of paricipants in half, to get below the maximimum 50 limit for group pings; and also removed initial '#'s from the start of lines for participants.But the <span style=\"VISIBILITY:hidden;display:none\"> added by the {{Ping project}} template is being ignored -- I'm still getting a visible list of names, which usually means something is broken & the ping isn't going to work.Can anybody spot what I have missed, and how to fix it?Also pinging @Zolo, TomT0m: to see if they can see anything. Jheald (talk) 12:55, 12 June 2018 (UTC) I have already been investigating this but couldn't find a good solution (maybe because I don't like how it's made up). All the pages can be found at Special:LintErrors/html5-misnesting, which links to mw:Help:Extension:Linter/html5-misnesting. The problem is that you have newlines inside the span tag which isn't permitted anymore (since Tidy → RemeX switch). Matěj Suchánek (talk) 14:57, 12 June 2018 (UTC) I cleaned-up the lists of a few WikiProjects as they started displaying every time they were used. I think the thing to do is to remove anything but the name, e.g. Wikidata:WikiProject Chemistry/Participants. --- Jura 15:00, 12 June 2018 (UTC) @Zolo, TomT0m, Matěj Suchánek, Jura1: Bizarre -- it seems the problem had nothing to do with numbered lists, or signatures, or anything else on the list pages themselves, because {{Ping project|sum of all paintings}} always seems to work for User:Thierry Caro, eg on this proposal Instead ultimately I found that what broke the formatting or not was simply whether I had tried to indent the line or not: if I started the line with a :, then nothing I could do would stop all of the names being shown. But if I removed the : then they would all be hidden. As I said, bizarre. But (I hope) I have now managed to ping the project successfully. Jheald (talk) 18:11, 12 June 2018 (UTC) This solved the problem for Wikidata:WikiProject France/Participants. Thierry Caro (talk) 18:14, 12 June 2018 (UTC) I think it's the combination of the two. There are lists that didn't show before, but started displaying after some users added their names with more fun formatting. --- Jura 04:51, 13 June 2018 (UTC) Update on page issues on mobile web Update on page issues on mobile web Please help translate to your language Hi everyone. The Readers web team has recently begun working on exposing issue templates on the mobile website. Currently, details about issues with page content are generally hidden on the mobile website. This leaves readers unaware of the reliability of the pages they are reading. The goal of this project is to improve awareness of particular issues within an article on the mobile web. We will do this by changing the visual styling of page issues. So far, we have drafted a proposal on the design and implementation of the project. We were also able to run user testing on the proposed designs. The tests so far have positive results. Here is a quick summary of what we learned: The new treatment increases awareness of page issues among participants. This is true particularly when they are in a more evaluative/critical mode. Page issues make sense to readers and they understand how they work Readers care about page issues and consider them important Readers had overwhelmingly positive sentiments towards Wikipedia associated with learning about page issues Our next step would be to start implementing these changes. We wanted to reach out to you for any concerns, thoughts, and suggestions you might have before beginning development. Please visit the project page where we have more information and mockups of how this may look. Please leave feedback on the talk page. CKoerner (WMF) (talk) 20:58, 12 June 2018 (UTC)Played in ballets/operas/drama Which property should we use to link ballet with dancers who danced it? cast member (P161), participant (P710)? And should we at all (each ballet can be staged from 0 to hundreds of times). And how to indicate that a dancer participated in some ballet? participant in (P1344), significant event (P793) or even employer (P108)? --Infovarius (talk) 10:48, 7 June 2018 (UTC) I think we shouldn't. As to items for individual productions of a ballet, that's something else, they could have some cast info, but even this is quite beyond the scope of what Wikidata can possibly do. --Anvilaquarius (talk) 10:54, 7 June 2018 (UTC) Hm, Wikidata makes impossible possible! :) Anyway it seems like a logical question to try to answer in Wikidata: \"in what ballets this dancer danced?\" It is very similar to roles in films which we support. --Infovarius (talk) 14:19, 7 June 2018 (UTC) For what it's worth, the original cast of a ballet is usually significant in a way that later casts are not. Very often, the ballet was choreographed with particular dancers in mind; any later production is something of a recreation. - Jmabel (talk) 16:09, 7 June 2018 (UTC) As to the model indicated at WikiProject Theatre you would need an item for the production of the ballet the dancer participated in. There you could add the dancers using cast member (P161). One could think about allowing some shortcut by creating a new property \"(significant) roles\" and using the character role (linked to the ballet/opera/drama via present in work (P1441)) to link between dancer and ballet. Then you would only need to create the role. This way we could get all dancers who danced Odette or Carabosse (without the need to indicate every production they performed this role in - which can be many). One could do the same with opera singers (e.g. to indicate who performed the role of Rusalka in Rusalka (Q831255)). - Valentina.Anitnelav (talk) 17:43, 7 June 2018 (UTC) Or one could just use performer (P175) at the character itself (e.g. <Rusalka>present in work (P1441)Rusalka (Q831255);performer (P175)Asmik Grigorian (Q11201210)). - Valentina.Anitnelav (talk) 17:52, 7 June 2018 (UTC) Hi, I think it might be useful at some point to have a property \"significant roles\" in analogy to notable work (P800) - especially as we have started to ingest performing arts productions in a systematic manner (see: WikiProject:Performing arts). I would however be a bit hesitant about using performer (P175) on the character item itself; in case of popular works, the list would simply get too long. --Beat Estermann (talk) 08:28, 13 June 2018 (UTC) Are operating systems \"works\"? I ask because of another warning I've run into trying to articulate the examples in Help:Modelling/By domains: ⟨ GNU variant (Q1475825)    ⟩ based on (P144) ⟨ GNU (Q44571)    ⟩ : problematic as of 2018-06-08 because based on (P144) has a property constraint (P2302) that is supposed to restrict it to classes that descend from work (Q386724), cultivar (Q4886), or performing arts production (Q43099500). Perhaps operating system (Q9135) should add ⟨ operating system (Q9135)    ⟩ instance of (P31) ⟨ work (Q386724)    ⟩ ? - Jmabel (talk) 04:06, 9 June 2018 (UTC) Jmabel - the operating systems modelled in Wikidata are classes, not instances. 2.243.72.218 07:58, 9 June 2018 (UTC) I think the problem here is that GNU variant (Q1475825) isn't an instance. There is a way to change the constraint to accept both instances and classes, if it's appropriate: using instance or subclass of (Q30208840) in the relation. Ghouston (talk) 08:38, 9 June 2018 (UTC) Sorry, in what relation, I don't follow that last statement. - Jmabel (talk) 16:52, 9 June 2018 (UTC) I mean on the constraint on based on (P144). There's only one constraint, and it requires that the based on (P144) statement be placed on an item that's an instance of work, cultivar, or performing arts production. If it's normal that a pure subclass like GNU variant (Q1475825) is also a \"work\", then the constraint can be changed from relation instance of (Q21503252) to relation instance or subclass of (Q30208840). Ghouston (talk) 04:00, 10 June 2018 (UTC) I'll just do it, anybody can change it back if they think it's wrong. Ghouston (talk) 04:02, 10 June 2018 (UTC) Thanks, I didn't even know that was a possibility, and to be honest I'm sure I don't yet properly understand the creation of constraints here. - Jmabel (talk) 04:25, 10 June 2018 (UTC) Jmabel, \"GNU variant\" (Q1475825) looks similar to \"individual aircraft\" (Q21051516). Each not needed for modelling. Items are subclasses of GNU (OS) or aircraft or in case of the latter there are also items that are instances of aircraft, but I am not aware that there would be any instance of an OS be described here. 85.180.29.96 06:57, 10 June 2018 (UTC) Sure, the variants themselves can based on (P144) GNU (Q44571) instead of subclass of GNU variant (Q1475825). Wikidata tends to have this problem, superfluous items that need to be kept because they have Wikipedia articles, giving multiple ways to do the same thing. Ghouston (talk) 08:53, 10 June 2018 (UTC) GNU variant = GNU subclass? Each OS item is an instance of a variant? GNU variant a \"metaclass\" (Q19478619)? German description says \"ein GNU-Betriebssystem, das nicht Hurd als Kernel verwenden\" - the variants are only those GNU OS that are not GNU/Hurd OS. 85.180.29.96 09:22, 10 June 2018 (UTC) OK. So... In reworking Help:Modelling, I've been trying when possible to flesh out the (mininally elaborated) examples already there, instead of coming in as an outsider and deciding what are good examples. But, increasingly, it looks like it wasn't even a list of good examples! No wonder it's been hard for outsiders like me coming from sister projects to make head or tail of how to do things here. Do I understand correctly that \"GNU variant\" isn't even a good example of what comes up in modeling OSs, and shouldn't be used as an example? If some items like \"GNU variant\" and \"individual aircraft\" shouldn't be used as properties of other items, shouldn't there be some property to mark them as disparaged deprecated? minor reword 22:16, 11 June 2018 (UTC) Jumping back to my initial question in this section: I would think that OSs are \"works\" (as are programs and software packages in general). Is there any argument against having a statement that says so? - Jmabel (talk) 17:16, 10 June 2018 (UTC) Jmabel \"Is there any argument against having a statement that says so?\" - Why would that be done by a (= one?) statement as it something that is done by Wikidata:Classification? 92.228.157.51 12:41, 11 June 2018 (UTC) Of course it could and presumably should be done by indirect subclassing. And it looks like it now is. So I take it that was not the cause of the warning I had above, and it was merely the badly done constraint. Fine. My first two questions just above still stand. - Jmabel (talk) 22:08, 11 June 2018 (UTC) Jmabel, \"deprecated\" in what sense? Wikidata started with the goal to collect statements, not to invent statements. Most common are statements in source what something is, not what it is not. So one finds A isA B, less often A isNotA B. But even more rare would be \"B is deprecated for 'A isA B'\". And in that specific case, was it ever endorsed by someone else than Wikidata contributors?85.181.248.20 12:56, 12 June 2018 (UTC) I feel like I'm having to discuss this with a ghost, in that you come in from an IP address, and all of the possibilities that entails, including that you might be someone evading a block. Please log in. \"Deprecated\" meaning that it would almost always be a mistake to use these as the target of a property. If \"individual aircraft\" is not an appropriate instance of (P31) for an individual aircraft, that is very confusing. If a variant of GNU should not be an instance of \"GNU variant\", that is very confusing. - Jmabel (talk) 16:12, 13 June 2018 (UTC) Why is there no character restriction in English? on focus list of Wikimedia project (P5008) : I made the translation in Turkish. But it gives a warning that is limited to 250 characters. However, the number of English characters is 353. If you only want to do Wikidata in English, let us know. This is a huge bullshit. --İncelemeelemani (talk) 10:54, 10 June 2018 (UTC) Seems as odious a way of raising an issue as I can think of. --Tagishsimon (talk) 12:12, 10 June 2018 (UTC) Attack the reporter, that is what is odious. And certainly there are ways more odious, so your statement is propaganda against İncelemeelemani. 85.180.29.96 14:00, 10 June 2018 (UTC) It can hurt to tell the truths and listen to them. --İncelemeelemani (talk) 10:26, 11 June 2018 (UTC) @HakanIST: Any thoughts on the subject? Mahir256 (talk) 12:18, 10 June 2018 (UTC) Isn't this caused by the use of non-standard characters? Wostr (talk) 15:27, 10 June 2018 (UTC) @Wostr: No it is not. At first I gave you the right. However, I tried my miraheze.org site. The old Wikibase version also has a 250 character limit for English. You can even try without a member. Please do not hesitate. AND language selector plugin is not found.... What kind of English language can be a privilege? I'm curious. Also, would you please try to add more than 250 characters in your own language? Add-on version This error occurs when you want to add 353 English characters to this slide. --İncelemeelemani (talk) 10:06, 11 June 2018 (UTC)  I think this is just an old bug. When you create an item, the data is not validated and can be longer than 250 chars. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 10:42, 11 June 2018 (UTC) Not English Language hegemony? Disappointing for İncelemeelemani's thesis. --Tagishsimon (talk) 17:32, 13 June 2018 (UTC) Help pages Users from other projects comes to this project to add and change items and statements about their articles, and more often than not they don't read English very well. They need introductions in their own language, or some other language they can understand.A lot of the help pages use a local template to link manually translated pages instead of using the on-wiki translation support. It is very difficult to keep the translations in sync, and it wastes manpower as manual translation is slow and error prone.Simply abandon the translations of the help pages that has the (crappy) template system, clean up the source version (they are bloathed), and mark them for translation.

ArthurPSmith (talk) 15:05, 11 June 2018 (UTC) Capitalization is only a minor detail. Jeblad (talk) 19:07, 11 June 2018 (UTC) I would hope soon to add Help:Modelling and its subpages to this list; I believe I have that more or less beaten into shape. - Jmabel (talk) 22:13, 11 June 2018 (UTC) Take a look at how many help pages with templates are in fact translated, and compare to how many are translated if they are set up for the translation system. Use the templates and the help pages will nearly ever be translated, and they will be horribly outdated. Jeblad (talk) 09:45, 13 June 2018 (UTC) When it comes to label/description/alias there's no need to have the same rules for different languages. As such I don't think it should be translated this way. One practical example is romanization. How to do it can be decided invidually by the people who actually speak the relevant language.

Mahir256 (talk) 15:15, 13 June 2018 (UTC) Rank of secondary identifier Some items have more than one ChEBI ID (P683). In ChEBI there is only one primary ID for each entry, but sometimes entries have also secondary IDs (and sometimes these sec IDs are also present in WD). ChEBI ID (P683) has single-value constraint (Q19474404), so should I: mark secondary IDs as deprecated and add reason for deprecated rank (P2241) = Qxxx secondary ChEBI ID mark primary ID as preferred (that however won't remove item from constraint violations list) add item to exception to constraint (P2303) in ChEBI ID (P683) (but that would probably be hundreds of exceptions) ? Wostr (talk) 15:47, 11 June 2018 (UTC) It's a question that comes up once in a while. Most of the time, we just ignore it, unless the constraint is set to mandatory. Maybe the single value constraint should simply be removed. --- Jura 16:29, 11 June 2018 (UTC) I think I'll try to ignore it then. Wostr (talk) 17:30, 11 June 2018 (UTC) Wostr - why would secondary be WD:deprecated? Content follows reality or content follows WD's constraint violation lists? 92.228.157.51 17:22, 11 June 2018 (UTC) Because it's one of possible options. I won't answer the second question as it's irrelevant. Wostr (talk) 17:30, 11 June 2018 (UTC) I think it depends on why there are two identifiers. If they are a duplicate in the other database then the right thing to do is to mark one as prefered and one as normal. --LydiaPintscher (talk) 18:11, 11 June 2018 (UTC) I think it's a result of merging different entries in this database, but I couldn't find any confirmation. Wostr (talk) 21:15, 13 June 2018 (UTC) that however won't remove item from constraint violations list – I’d just like to point out that the single best value constraint type exists :) --Lucas Werkmeister (WMDE) (talk) 15:16, 12 June 2018 (UTC) Okay, thanks, that may be the solution, I'll discuss this in WikiProject Chemistry. Wostr (talk) 21:15, 13 June 2018 (UTC) Fixing a regular expression for a format constraint Irish National Monument ID (P4059) has currently a format constraint with the following regular expression “[1-9]\\d*(,\\d+)?” which was in the original proposal. This is, however, not correct. Irish national monument numbers consist of multiple digits, optionally followed by a letter. Hence “[1-9]\\d*[A-Z]?” would be more appropriate. Example: St. Dairbhile's Church (Q17276540) has monument number 99A per the official list by the Irish Government. Where should format fixes like this be discussed? Is it possible to run a test to see what would be affected by such a change? Thanks, AFBorchert (talk) 05:10, 13 June 2018 (UTC) if it's just a matter of correcting the regex, I'd go ahead and do it (it's at Property:P4059#P2302). The template on the talk page of the property includes a sparql query that generally works to check how the current values match it. --- Jura 05:17, 13 June 2018 (UTC) According to this older list the identifier for that item should be 99,01. Anyway, as Jura said, on Property talk:P4059 you find this query in the constraints boxes, where you can test whether things break if you change the regex. It is okay to just fix it, but you can leave a notice on the property talk page too, if you like. —MisterSynergy (talk) 05:24, 13 June 2018 (UTC) Thank you for your help!

Do I add a category at Wikisource or just add the url to Wikidata? --RAN (talk) 13:52, 13 June 2018 (UTC) You would first need to create the article on Wikisource, and transclude the page content. Once there is a page on Wikisource for the specific article, then you create a Wikidata item for that article. Then you can link the WD item for the person to the WD item for the article. We already do this with the Dictionary of National Biography entries, the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, and a few similar works. --EncycloPetey (talk) 21:17, 13 June 2018 (UTC) Can you show an example, I only see links to authors, and portals for subjects of articles tend to be deleted. --RAN (talk) 04:14, 14 June 2018 (UTC) Some towns don't have \"instance of\" Q3957 while description shows they are towns Examples: Alibunar (Q648863) Pale (Q222084) That makes extraction of towns from the database difficult to me.

I'm not familiar with how towns/cities/settlements are handled on Wikidata, but terms like \"town\" can be a bit problematic, because their exact definition can be vague and varies between languages and countries. See en:Town for all the different definitions. So a settlement (to use a broad term) might be described as a \"town\" (town (Q3957)) in English, but might not necessarily fall under the definitions of the respective labels in other languages on town (Q3957). --Kam Solusar (talk) 06:55, 9 June 2018 (UTC) @Mladen.adamovic: French description of Alibunar (Q648863) says it is a \"ville\", should we add city (Q515)?

DONE	10000 How to check the other 9999? What rule was used for all of them? 85.180.29.96 14:23, 10 June 2018 (UTC) In what way was Q11081 not the main subject of this paper? --Tagishsimon (talk) 14:34, 10 June 2018 (UTC) Are you trolling? 85.180.29.96 14:42, 10 June 2018 (UTC) No. Explain why Alzheimer's disease is an inappropriate main subject for a paper entitled \"ADO: a disease ontology representing the domain knowledge specific to Alzheimer's disease.\" --Tagishsimon (talk) 14:48, 10 June 2018 (UTC) 'cos at first glance, you'd think a paper on Alzheimer's Disease Ontology might have something to do with Alzheimer's Disease. --Tagishsimon (talk) 14:50, 10 June 2018 (UTC) Why that? The topic is ADO not AD. 85.180.29.96 15:34, 10 June 2018 (UTC) And meanwhile - but only because you asked so nicely and are clearly a splendid person, Special:Contributions/QuickStatementsBot is where you go to \"check\" the other 9999. --Tagishsimon (talk) 14:52, 10 June 2018 (UTC) Certainly not. 85.180.29.96 15:40, 10 June 2018 (UTC) Ah, I see. You want the main subject to be ADO so you've created Alzheimer's Disease Ontology (Q54887745) in such a way as to sever all links between the paper's item, and the disease. That seems completely misguided and counterproductive. --Tagishsimon (talk) 15:13, 10 June 2018 (UTC) In the conversation here only to you. FTR, the ADO item was created well ahead before the statement of the article item was changed. You have no proof anywhere for your claim. (cur | prev) 14:16, 10 June 2018‎ 85.180.29.96 (talk)‎ . .

One tends to create items before adding them in statements to other items. It does not work well the other way around. Meanwhile, you linked the main subject of the paper to an article which had no links to the disease. Explain, please, how someone interested in a report on all papers the main subject of which relate to Alzheimer's disease will find the paper with Q54887745 as you designed it? This is what I mean by misguided and counterproductive. --Tagishsimon (talk) 15:44, 10 June 2018 (UTC) Not true. In most cases one can add items before creating them first, because others have created them. But still, only because an item was created before it was added, which is what must happen, does not mean that the item creator wants the created item to be the main subject of anything. So, maybe you have seen that (\"Ah, I see\") but your see-tools must have fooled you, since my brain is still in my head and no one else is in the room here. 85.180.29.96 16:15, 10 June 2018 (UTC) You did not explain how the article could be found, based on your confection of main subject. That structure/mapping question is the substantive issue right now. A second issue - given the 40,000:1 ratio of artcles with main subject of AD versus main subject of ADO - is whether you have any grasp of the relationship between granularity of subject indexing, and discoverability of records; your absolutist approach suggests not. --Tagishsimon (talk) 20:24, 10 June 2018 (UTC) Dear Tagishsimon, thank you very much for your feedback. You are very eloquent. You also seem to like to control the discussion and not only that also lead it to something useful. I have one question - why do you talk so much about users and don't spend all your time talking about what you call substantive issue? 92.230.136.177 01:21, 11 June 2018 (UTC) You seem to be off topic. Please explain how the article can be found by someone interested in Alzheimer's Disease under your arrangement of dissociating it entirely from Alzheimer's Disease. --Tagishsimon (talk) 07:54, 11 June 2018 (UTC) \"You seem to be off topic.\" - why do you talk so much about users? And what is \"Alzheimer's Disease\"? 92.228.157.51 12:44, 11 June 2018 (UTC) You're a dishonest person and you're arguing in bad faith. There's no point in continuing the discussion. --Tagishsimon (talk) 17:28, 11 June 2018 (UTC) Tagishsimon, Dear Tagishsimon, you wrote \"You're a dishonest person\" - why do you talk so much about users?

 Try it! As of 2018-06-11 : 40851 92.228.157.51 12:56, 11 June 2018 (UTC) QuickStatementsBot - AD - discussion part 2 Please note, main subject (P921), while its English label suggests should be unique, has no such constraint defined, and in typical use applied to scientific articles I would expect several \"main subjects\" to be relevant for search and retrieval purposes. So there's nothing wrong with adding \"AD\" and \"ADO\" and whatever else people think is relevant. P921 values that are to any degree helpful for searching should NOT be removed! ArthurPSmith (talk) 15:02, 11 June 2018 (UTC) ArthurPSmith, it was replaced with something more specific. 92.228.157.51 16:29, 11 June 2018 (UTC) I think it would be much better to add ontology (Q324254) and Alzheimer's disease (Q11081) (or maybe with of (P642)) in ADO: a disease ontology representing the domain knowledge specific to Alzheimer's disease (Q38448813) than creating something like Alzheimer's Disease Ontology (Q54887745) that would be probably used only in ADO: a disease ontology representing the domain knowledge specific to Alzheimer's disease (Q38448813). Wostr (talk) 15:27, 11 June 2018 (UTC) \"that would be probably used only\" - what is your source? 92.228.157.51 16:27, 11 June 2018 (UTC) Somewhat relevant to this discussion, Wikidata:Property proposal/subject facet proposes a new property for \"keywords\" as distinct from \"main subjects\" of a work. Jheald (talk) 19:12, 11 June 2018 (UTC) An item like Alzheimer's Disease Ontology (Q54887745) allows that ontology to be listed when someone queries for all ontologies that use BFO. It's a notable entity apart from a desire to describe the topic of that paper. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 14:40, 14 June 2018 (UTC) Homo sapiens as the source of human breast milk User:Brya has twice removed from Homo sapiens (Q15978631) the statement this taxon is source of (P1672) - breast milk (Q22728), asking in his second edit summary \"where are the herds of Homo sapiens kept for milking, where are the stores selling breast milk?\". I've reverted, but a that's my second revert, am raising the matter here for wider community input. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 20:12, 10 June 2018 (UTC) Sounds like language issues. \"Product\" has multiple meanings in English, and I'm strongly inclined to believe that in this case it refers to the \"result\" sense, not the \"commercial good\" sense. However, sometimes ambiguities like this result in descriptions with different meanings. @Brya: What language do you use as your interface setting? --Yair rand (talk) 02:37, 11 June 2018 (UTC) Obviously, \"natural product of taxon\" here refers to something that is traded, often enough internationally. The property often is misused, for example for when \"found in taxon\" should be used. If \"result\" is allowed in, a huge inflation would result: almost anything would qualify, like \"human kidney\", \"nail clippings\", and way beyond. If a property for that is felt to be necessary, create a new property for that. - Brya (talk) 04:05, 11 June 2018 (UTC) I agree with Brya here. Otherwise it would be possible to list thousands of products. It would make more sense to link in some way from human breast milk to human (or Homo Sapiens) then the other way around. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 11:18, 11 June 2018 (UTC) The argument - Brya's argument - for creating this taxon is source of (P1672) was \"We now have the property \"natural product of taxon\", so it would make sense to also have the reciprocal relationship.\". Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 12:10, 11 June 2018 (UTC) Yes, and the examples in the proposals are clear on that this is for tradeable natural products. It might be argued that Homo sapiens 'produces' sweat and urine, but it would be singularly pointless to record this with this property. And there are several ways to link \"human breast milk\" to Homo sapiens without using the property \"natural product of taxon\". - Brya (talk) 16:38, 11 June 2018 (UTC) Since you insist on such a pedantic interpretation (wholly unjustified by either the aforesaid examples or by the terms of the property proposal): [8] [9] [10]. And human urine has been used for centuries in agriculture, tanning, gunpowder production, and other trades; including being collected commercially: en:Urine#Uses. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 18:11, 11 June 2018 (UTC) The question is not if human breast milk is sometimes sold (human kidneys are sometimes sold), but if it is widely accepted as a tradable product. There are taboos and laws against selling it. More importantly, human breast milk is very commonly present, but its role in human society is not that of a tradeable product; only a very minute portion of the whole is sold. - Brya (talk) 05:25, 12 June 2018 (UTC) That is a question of your own invention. It need not trouble us here. Levels of trade, taboos, and laws are all red herrings. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 09:09, 12 June 2018 (UTC) Reality is out there, no matter how hard some people try to ignore it. - Brya (talk) 16:34, 12 June 2018 (UTC) Reality is that this is a quite popular (but still niche) product: [11], [12], [13], [14]... --Infovarius (talk) 15:30, 14 June 2018 (UTC) Item for cities Hello. We have:million city (Q1637706) city with a population of more than 1,000,000average city (Q896881) cities with populations from 20,000 to 100,000Is there an item for cities with population from 100,000 to 1,000,000? Or something else between the first two items. Xaris333 (talk) 11:56, 11 June 2018 (UTC) These are very ancient items. It is much better to use population (P1082) only. In fact it may be a good idea to deprecate usage of these items.--Jklamo (talk) 15:14, 11 June 2018 (UTC) Yes, I agree with that. Xaris333 (talk) 15:48, 11 June 2018 (UTC) There is big city (Q1549591) for population from 100,000 to 1,000,000 but I also recommend to not use these items in statements but instead population (P1082). --Pasleim (talk) 21:08, 11 June 2018 (UTC) Checked items with million city (Q1637706) or average city (Q896881) and without population (P1082) (10 items), added population (P1082) in these items, million city (Q1637706) and average city (Q896881) removed.--Jklamo (talk) 19:22, 12 June 2018 (UTC) They must be remove also from items that already have population (P1082). Xaris333 (talk) 19:43, 12 June 2018 (UTC) I have removed most of them yesterday, but it seems some of them were missed by my query. Removed rest of them today.--Jklamo (talk) 13:59, 13 June 2018 (UTC) Very good. I think we must remove also Q50330360 and big city (Q1549591). I am not sure about port settlement (Q2264924). Xaris333 (talk) 17:18, 13 June 2018 (UTC) @Jklamo: I object. Please don't be destructive and restore all of them. In most cities (at least where I added these statements) this values are original (in the sense that they cannot be covered by existed P1082 claims) and useful. Moreover, often deletion loses the information at all (as there are no other information about reaching such milestones, at least in P1082 claims). And about Q50330360, let's discuss it, when you will be able to represent the same information without this item. --Infovarius (talk) 12:55, 14 June 2018 (UTC) Try for example to answer questions: \"Which millioner cities were there at 1910?\", \"What is the first 100,000 city?\" with aid of only P1082. --Infovarius (talk) 15:55, 14 June 2018 (UTC) Please restore all removed claims! Or at least replace them with similar ones without population. With your removal of e.g. Birmingham (Q2256) it is no longer instance of city (Q515) and it breaks a lot of queries that rely on that kind of city hierarchy. Broken query example: SELECT ?city { ?city wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q515. } Usefulnes of full statistical history of a country How useful would it be to have a full history of statistics of a country? For example we would like to add a large amount of the Central Bureau of Statistics(Netherlands) data as properties with values per year for the \"Netherlands\" item (Q55). As an example we have added a small amount of this data to the test.wikidata page for the \"Netherlands\" item. https://test.wikidata.org/wiki/Q165131. Historical data for the \"Population\" item is the example, we would replicate this for hundreds of properties of The Netherlands. It would probably add 100,000+ data items of current and historical data of the country.Our concern is that it might be too much data to add to a single item and wouldn't be useful to anyone since the same data is readily available at the CBS website (https://opendata.cbs.nl). – The preceding unsigned comment was added by CBSBot (talk • contribs). I would rather have this data available as JSONstat, with sufficient information in the item to load it as necessary. Most statistics isn't about a specific item, but about an intersection between several items. Netherlands, children and kindergarten for example. Jeblad (talk) 14:32, 13 June 2018 (UTC) @Jeblad: So you would say that this type of data is not suitable to be placed on wikidata? CBSBot @CBSBot: I've been wondering about statistics, and when it is sufficient important to an subject to include it as a set of claims. A nation consists of people, and I guess it would be prudent to include statistics about those people in the item about the nation. It could also be rephrased so that if you have statistics between an instance and a class, then the statistics goes in the instance. What if you turn it around, and you have statistics between a class and a set of instances, then it isn't obvious where the statistics goes. Jeblad (talk) 13:56, 14 June 2018 (UTC) @CBSBot, Jeblad: Use tabular population (P4179), or propose another tabular property if that's not sufficient. ArthurPSmith (talk) 15:03, 13 June 2018 (UTC) @ArthurPSmith: I have previously criticized tabular data at Commons, because JSONstat isn't implemented. Jeblad (talk) 14:01, 14 June 2018 (UTC) @CBSBot, Jeblad: well, whether the Commons tabular format is sufficient or not, it's the only alternative option we have at the moment. The wikidata software cannot handle more than a few thousand statements on an item at present (the user interface becomes essentially unusable at that point) so no, it would not be a good idea to have 100,000+ statements on Netherlands (Q55).

Pmt (talk) 07:27, 14 June 2018 (UTC) Changes by PreferentialBot Never fun to find that a bot does something wrong, but the assumption PreferentialBot does creates problems. It assumes current state to be preferred, but this neglects the history (the past) of the claim. That is it enforces interpretation of the claim in a specific context. This is not a problem for Wikipedia-projects that focuses on infoboxes with current content (what it is now), but it poses a problem for those projects that has infoboxes with complete histories (how it were back then). Rephrased you may say that what's preferred depends on expectations about the infobox, but this is a slight simplification.To reiterate; the error is the assumption that current is the same as preferred, which is not a general truth. In fact, preferred can be harder to get right than deprecated. The solution is either to stop the bot or to stop reusing the preferred rank while building the infoboxes for the client articles. Jeblad (talk) 09:36, 13 June 2018 (UTC) One question on this. Does the bot create the problem, or is it only showing the problem in more items? To me it feels the latter is the real issue, and then the bot isn't the solution. Edoderoo (talk) 09:41, 13 June 2018 (UTC) The problem is general, and as far as I know it can't be properly solved. You can rephrase it as preferred to be some extreme value in some dimension, but there can always be some other use case with other extreme values in some other dimensions. Jeblad (talk) 09:52, 13 June 2018 (UTC) The bot doesn't do that for all properties, only for the ones where this is thought to be useful. For infoboxes that should display any non-deprecated statements, one just needs to select differently. --- Jura 09:43, 13 June 2018 (UTC) The infoboxes are just an example, and the problem is even worse for content templates. I have just posted a warning at nowiki about using \"best\" statements, as they are now randomly broken. Jeblad (talk) 09:56, 13 June 2018 (UTC) Do you have samples of statements that you consider broken? --- Jura 09:59, 13 June 2018 (UTC) In Hôtel du Gouverneur militaire de Lyon (Q20980610) [15] it can be said to be correct, as the property is the status. In Japanese Communist Party (Q641600) [16] it is wrong as it is nothing preferred with the current status. You may say that claims you can order somehow should not be marked as preferred (temporal ordering, Q2098061), or claims where the other claims does not carry any useful information (Q641600). Jeblad (talk) 11:19, 13 June 2018 (UTC) Q641600 still exists, so the ranked statement gives the answer to the question \"how many members does it have\". Once it's desolved, I'd argue that the most recent value shouldn't have that rank. There are few cases were I don't think preferred rank is helpful, but here it seems helpful. --- Jura 11:51, 13 June 2018 (UTC) You give yourself a problem, how to formulate a question to get a specific answer, and find a question, but that isn't the only valid question and thus the solution isn't universally valid. The proper question is given by the context on the client, not carefully chosen by the answer on the repo. The only time preferred makes sense is when all ordering (instantiations) over all valid domains leads to preferred being the valid choice, or at least for the interesting domains. Note that unordered is also an ordering, as is ascending and descending order, so the only case where preferred makes sense is for a truly unordered set. Jeblad (talk) 12:09, 13 June 2018 (UTC) Which question(s) would it answer incorrectly? --- Jura 12:20, 13 June 2018 (UTC) Any question involving for example the history will be wrong. (Second sentence in the opening post: It assumes current state to be preferred, but this neglects the history (the past) of the claim.) Jeblad (talk) 14:26, 13 June 2018 (UTC) I don't think so. Can you formulate one? --- Jura 05:02, 15 June 2018 (UTC) Isn't this exactly how \"preferred\" is supposed to be used? From Help:Ranking: \"The preferred rank is assigned to the most current statement or statements that best represent consensus (be it scientific consensus or the Wikidata community consensus).\" Ghouston (talk) 10:43, 13 June 2018 (UTC) This is the core of the problem, the current value isn't necessarily preferred, and it isn't necessarily any consensus between projects on what is best. As I said back in 2012, preferred should be abandoned, it creates a lot of problems as it implies non-formal rules that isn't shared by the clients. Jeblad (talk) 11:24, 13 June 2018 (UTC) Why don't you see Help:Sources as a consensus? ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 11:47, 13 June 2018 (UTC) Lua data access allows to retrieve either best or valid statements, the API and SPARQL allow retrieval of ranks. Whatever data consumer wants to get not only current, but also historical information has all the means in their hands to do that. --Marsupium (talk) 10:46, 13 June 2018 (UTC) I don't think the bot is your problem. It uses the concept as it's supposed to be used according to Help:Sources. The problem comes from the \"preferred\" rank being used to mark two distinct things. On the one hand it marks that a certain datum is more trustworthy than others and on the other hand it marks with datum is current. One way to solve this would be to add an additional rank of \"current&preferred\". ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 11:46, 13 June 2018 (UTC) The bot does not use the sources at all, and even if it did use them it can't say anyhing about the trustworthyness of individual sources unless it has a lot more information than what is available on this project. It is also quite easy to verify that it changes unsourced claims. The present rank-solution is really a two-dimensional thingy with six valid positions, where two normal values are merged, and two other positions are neglected, leaving three positions. Adding a third dimension isn't going to simplify the problem at all. (Note that current is temporally close on a time scale, with near as spatial scales as one other alternative. What about similar in shape?) Jeblad (talk) 12:27, 13 June 2018 (UTC) Typography and alphabets Do we have any standards about representing typography and alphabets and/or any WikiProject that would have that in its scope? - Jmabel (talk) 05:44, 14 June 2018 (UTC) @Jmabel: There is almost inactive Wikidata:WikiProject Alphabet and ongoing edits about adding part of (P361) to letters (see e.g. A (Q9659)). Also I've done a classification of graphemes some time ago. --Infovarius (talk) 15:51, 14 June 2018 (UTC) @Infovarius: Thanks! - Jmabel (talk) 19:47, 14 June 2018 (UTC) Use of instance of (P31) 90.191.81.65 argues that mineral (Q7946) should be only used for mineral samples. Entities using the chemical formula property should be instances of one of the following classes (or of one of their subclasses): chemical compound. I think that a mineral sample is an instance of a mineral sample. The Science tree is rocks > facies > inorganic non-mineral compounds > minerals > mineral varities and species polytypes. Any comments? --Chris.urs-o (talk) 15:04, 14 June 2018 (UTC) @Chris.urs-o: This sounds like a comment from the blocked user Tobias Conradi (who is very hard to block by IP address). Nevertheless you (or the Mineralogy wikiproject) need to make a decision on whether mineral (Q7946) is a metaclass like chemical compound, or not. Chemicals are generally a bit of a mess - particularly proteins and other biological chemicals. But if you look at mineral (Q7946) right now, it's a subclass of chemical compound (Q11173) which is a metaclass but also of solid (Q11438) which (through the subclass tree) seems to be a subclass of concrete object (Q4406616), whose instances should be real physical objects and not classes of objects. So one of those two seems wrong, and which of them is removed would determine whether P31 is the right relation or not for specific types of minerals to mineral (Q7946). I would tend to favor using subclass of (P279) in this cases, with perhaps a \"variety of mineral\" class for the P31 relations, but I'm not an expert in this area.

To be clear, I think that mineral (Q7946) should be used for mineral species (items with chemical formula property), but the relation should be subclass of (P279). To me it seems that Help:Basic membership properties is quite clear on that. Mineral sample is \"an individual or a single thing\" (here real physical objects), mineral species is not. 90.191.81.65 16:10, 14 June 2018 (UTC) Does not seem to work. A valid mineral species is a subclass of a mineral group. Create item 'valid mineral species'?

Krestinin, Nightwish62, Fralambert: @Danrok, MSGJ, GZWDer, Joshbaumgartner, Srittau: @Almondega, Jura1, Pintoch:)After the discussion that we had here. This is the text that I would like to add to Wikidata:Property creatorsLosing this right:After a property creator has been inactive for a year, not creating properties and not participating in property proposal discussions, they might be asked by any member of the community if they want to continue holding the right. At this point they will have the opportunity to be active again, or lose temporarily the property creator rights until they decide to apply again to the right, either through the standard process or through the fast process if it is within 6 months of their last logged action (see below).Property creator rights can also be removed after a community discussion at Wikidata:Requests for permissions/Removal, upon consensus supporting the removal.Property creator access can also be removed due to voluntary resignation of the property creator. Property creators wishing to resign their access may request removal at Wikidata:Administrators' noticeboard. If the Property creator wishes to regain their access after a voluntary resign, it can be requested at Wikidata:Administrators' noticeboard within 6 months of their last logged action in line with the inactivity policy.Any comment?--Micru (talk) 07:06, 7 June 2018 (UTC) Looks good to me! − Pintoch (talk) 08:23, 7 June 2018 (UTC) No need to ask stewards to remove rights, because Wikidata admins can remove property creator user rights. Stryn (talk) 12:45, 7 June 2018 (UTC) Ok, I replaced it by the Wikidata:Administrators' noticeboard.--Micru (talk) 14:20, 7 June 2018 (UTC) I'm alright with the first and last paragraphs, but oppose the vote language in the second. Rights should only be removed in cases where there is consensus, not merely on the basis of a 50/50 'vote'. I would also add the following language: \"In any case in which the holder has expressed their desire to retain the property creator right, inactivity alone shall not be cause for removal of said right.\" There is zero harm in someone only using their PC right sparingly. Josh Baumgartner (talk) 19:59, 7 June 2018 (UTC) @Joshbaumgartner: That vote paragraph is taken from Wikidata:Administrators#Losing_adminship. If you are not ok with it, we should change it for admins too. I agree that consensus should be more important than a vote. Any specific idea about how we should put that into words? I also agree that the PC right might be used sparingly, but I feel that a year without creating any property and not commenting on property proposals should be enough for the community to consider that this person might have lost interest or maybe doesn't have the time to work with properties. Also bear in mind that if someone loses their PC right they are neither being kicked out of the project, nor prevented of applying for the right again at a later date.--Micru (talk) 11:52, 8 June 2018 (UTC) @Micru: PC rights are different from the far more ranging administrators rights. There is no reason adminship rules should have to follow property creator guidelines. As for how to word it, simply replace the word \"vote\" with \"discussion\", and the \"with at least 50%...\" part with \"upon consensus\". My basic point is this, if the person says let me keep it, then done, they get to keep it (unless they have abused it somehow). If they really have gone inactive and have no desire to retain that role, then sure of course they can be removed from the rolls. What no one has been able to explain is what the harm is of someone having the PC right but only using it sparingly (including once every couple of years). Just because a property regarding their area of expertise only comes up infrequently, what value is there in having them have to re-apply each time? If the stated goal is to increase participation in property creation discussions, removing people's PC rights while they aren't looking and forcing them to re-apply won't help. Is there any actual case where someone having the PC right but not using it has caused a problem and thus justifies this effort in the first place, or are we just writing law to solve a hypothetical? Josh Baumgartner (talk) 16:12, 8 June 2018 (UTC) @Joshbaumgartner: I have modified the text above according to your suggestion (I hope other people are ok with the change). Regarding \"what the harm is of someone having the PC right but only using it sparingly\", I will try to explain the best I can my point of view on the topic: for me the collection of properties that we have is like a language, we use it to express things about the world, and like all languages somehow it is quite consistent (even more than most languages I would say). Creating a new property is like expanding the language, and I believe that in order to expand it you have to be familiar with what already exists, at least in your domain. I admit that properties now should be more domain specific, and that is problematic, because we don't have any way for property creators to specify which domain they want to oversee, nor users have the way to ping any specific property creator to review their proposal once it has been discussed. So we end up in a situation where all property creators are sort of watching all property proposal pages, and that is quite overwhelming for a single individual if they care about the whole process, as I do. My concern is, are all property creators really pulling their weight and solving complex discussions? Or are they left to die with nobody caring about them? Right now we have many proposals that have been open for more than 30 days, and some of them are still open even if they didn't have any comment for more than 2 months. This is in my view a failure from the community, because when it takes so long then the proposer maybe has lost interest by the time the property is created, so it is left unused, creating even more work (as @Jura1: once pointed out to me). For me it is stressful because it makes me lose the motivation to work on them if I am the only one solving these stalled situations. Sometimes when we had a big backlog I worked in bursts of activity to reduce it, but it doesn't address any issue, as then even more proposals are launched, and then the cycle begins again. What I would like to have is a list of people I can count on because they care about properties, and with whom I can discuss issues about property creation, like who takes care of what, or which reviewing processes we use to avoid pissing people off (as I have sometimes because I didn't have better ways of doing things). So for me those are the biggest issues, I don't mind so much if a property creator doesn't create a property in 10 years while he or she (is there any female PC btw?) maintains informed, cares about the process, and assists other PC. I think the first step is to know who is in, and for me to know if a person is in or not, it is not a matter of \"expressing interest\" because then the PC right becomes just another hat to collect, but in actually \"showing interest\" by doing something relevant in the domain they care about (be it direct creation, or discussing processes), and for me 1 year without not even commenting any property proposal doesn't show much interest from their side... Once said that, I also believe that PC should create properties only for a Wikiproject, because I think that the maintenance of the property, and the community-capacity to know how many properties can be maintained, can only be assessed by those who are interested in said properties, but I believe that is a matter for a future discussion.--Micru (talk) 17:04, 8 June 2018 (UTC) @Micru: The change looks good. I actually see where you are going at and I agree with you, it gets overwhelming and I am myself guilty of giving up at times in the face of the volume. I do try and respond if I am pinged on something, though if I don't have constructive input, I usually prefer to remain silent versus a generic support or oppose 'vote'. I occasionally browse the list of proposals in full, but as you mentioned there a lot for which I don't have any real input. I do think that a good ecosystem of properties created and curated by an engaged community would be ideal. I am all for anything that brings this about. One of the problems with a smaller number of people participating is that proposals need to remain longer in order to get sufficient discussion and ensure that input has been received. This exacerbates the problem of folks proposing properties, then giving up on them ever getting approved, and when they finally are created, having moved on to other things, leaving the property underutilized. I would like to see a more streamlined process for proposals that are more-or-less clear. Especially for authority control, an experience PC can look at an authority control property and pretty quickly gauge whether or not it is appropriate, and if so, how to set up the property with proper constraints and formatter, etc. As far as I am concerned, this should be something that can be done immediately by a PC if it meets certain criteria, which would both reduce backlog and the imposing volume of proposals as well as improve the use of the property by rapidly putting it in the hands of the community to use. To that end, I think we should perhaps have a select group of PCs that are even more actively engaged--a sort of property swat team. This is getting afield of the original issue, some of this is probably better discussed elsewhere. As for this proposal, I'm fine with the rewording, though I would still like to see something stating that a PC can not have their rights removed over their objections so long as there is no case of them abusing that right (my proposed wording is above). Add that simple protection and I can support this fully. As for other ways to improve the property ecosystem, consider me an ally and let's discuss some ideas. Josh Baumgartner (talk) 17:45, 8 June 2018 (UTC) @Joshbaumgartner: I don't understand why you want that PCs can keep they right even if they do not participate. Can you please explain your reasoning? --Micru (talk) 12:48, 11 June 2018 (UTC) @Micru: I've explained it multiple times in these threads. Let me add that just because one does not meet your narrow definition of 'participation' (as written in your proposed language) does not mean that they are not participating. It went unanswered before, but is there a real world case where we need this new rule, and in particular is there a real world case where we need the ability to remove the property creator right from a user who has not abused the right and wishes to retain it? Josh Baumgartner (talk) 17:02, 11 June 2018 (UTC) @Joshbaumgartner: What is 'participation' in your definition? Your question came also on the previous discussion (at the end, by ChristianKl), do you find my answer satisfactory enough?--Micru (talk) 08:17, 13 June 2018 (UTC) @Micru: I'm not the one seeking to create a limited definition of participation, that's what this proposal does above. Your answer from that previous thread seems to indicate that you want the list of property creators to be something it is not currently. So my suggestion is that instead of creating a lot of strife taking peoples' rights away, create a new list that meets your more stringent requirements. You are welcome to create a swat team of go-to folks if you want, but there is no need to punish the rest of the people who don't want to dance to that tune. Josh Baumgartner (talk) 15:39, 13 June 2018 (UTC) @Joshbaumgartner: You say that my definition of participation is limited, but what is your definition of participation?--Micru (talk) 20:33, 13 June 2018 (UTC) Is there a good reason to have a discussion about such a policy change in the Project Chat instead of creating a RfC? ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 12:19, 12 June 2018 (UTC) @ChristianKl: Yes, there is one, I'm quite disappointed with the RFC process here on Wikidata where the discussions stay open for too long and no effort is done to reach a reasonable conclusion before the conversation stales. Besides from my side I consider that this thread satisfies my limited time constraints, but of course if you feel that you need to talk more about this, you are free to start a RfC.--Micru (talk) 08:17, 13 June 2018 (UTC) I Oppose the proposal in the current form on the project chat, as I don't think this is the appropriate venue for policy changes that take away the rights of people, especially with the amount of participation that this thread got. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 22:18, 13 June 2018 (UTC) @ChristianKl: I am fine with moving it to a more appropriate venue. Josh Baumgartner (talk) 15:41, 13 June 2018 (UTC) Oppose There is no need for this proposal. Taking away user rights will not increase participation. There is no harm in allowing users to retain the property creator right even if inactive. I also agree with ChristianK1 that this is probably not the right place for this proposal. Josh Baumgartner (talk) 20:11, 14 June 2018 (UTC) @Joshbaumgartner, ChristianKl: I do feel the need to clarify the rights and responsibilities of Property Creators.

If the first two items you mention are really duplicates, it would perhaps be possible to merge fr:Taxonomie with fr:Classification scientifique des espèces. Ghouston (talk) 02:39, 15 June 2018 (UTC) As far as I am concerned, the purpose of Wikidata in linking is to connect pages on the same topic, not to force Wikipedias to re-compose their pages on Wikidata-selected topics. There are some users who try to place sitelinks so as to give Wikipedia pages the exposure they desire rather than in the item where the concepts is dealt with, but fortunately they are the exception. This means that if there is a single Wikipedia that has separate pages on related topics, Wikidata needs to have separate items. \"Taxonomy\" and \"biological classification\" are indeed related topics, but they are not necessarily the same concept. There is no reason why there should not be separate items, although exact placement of sitelinks may not be easy. The idea of moving sitelinks from \"d:Q8269924 (taxonomy, science of finding, describing, defining and naming groups of biological organisms)\" to the unrelated \"d:Q7211 (taxonomy, classification of things or concepts)\" just to make things look neater is really abhorrent. These are completely different concepts and should be kept separate, in any event. - Brya (talk) 04:23, 15 June 2018 (UTC) @Martinogk: Do not delete your comments once others have replied to them.

For example on Whitcomb L. Judson (Q731876) you see that he is an inventor but you don't see his invention. That's because discoverer or inventor (P61) only links from the invention to the inventor and not the other way round. To solve this general problem that statements are only displayed in one way I've written the script derivedstatements.js. The script adds at the end of all item pages a new button to load inverse statements.You can install the script by adding to Special:MyPage/common.js the following line: importScript( 'User:Pasleim/derivedstatements.js' ); // [[User:Pasleim/derivedstatements.js]] --Pasleim (talk) 19:33, 5 June 2018 (UTC) Wow, simply superb.

Nortix08 (talk) 04:59, 12 June 2018 (UTC) Hi again. Below a few thoughts after having seen the script in action for a few days: First, it would be good if the tool had a talk page where we can continue this discussion. Second, it is not clear to me from where you fetch the labels of the inverse properties. Example: Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny (Q760054) has a series of characters <inverse of: present in work (P1441)>. The derivedstatements feature presently uses \"shows\" as the label of the inverse property, while present in work (P1441) gives characters (P674) as its inverse property. – Should we not be declaring an inverse property for each property. And if so, how should we go about it? Third, how about duplicate information based on inverse statements on the items? – Example: Schauspielhaus Zürich (Q675022) has a statement <has part(s) (P527)> Main Stage (Schauspielhaus Zürich) (Q39918282), and the derivedstatements feature again lists the same information, because Main Stage (Schauspielhaus Zürich) (Q39918282) has an inverse part of (P361) statement. – Is this duplication of information by the script to be considered a bug or a feature? --Beat Estermann (talk) 07:31, 13 June 2018 (UTC) @Beat Estermann: Why don't use User talk:Pasleim/derivedstatements.js? --Marsupium (talk) 11:50, 13 June 2018 (UTC) Thanks!

I can't understand what to do... Xaris333 (talk) 14:53, 10 June 2018 (UTC) It seems to be expecting that there is a language wikipedia category associated with each instance of an executive body, and that there is a wikidata item for the wikipedia category, and that you'll use P910 to point from the instance of executive body item to the category item, as for example cabinet of Israel (Q2578249) does to Q10092812. I'm not convinced that the expectations of the constraint will always be delivered by language wikipedias. --Tagishsimon (talk) 15:02, 10 June 2018 (UTC) I am using executive body (P208) to Communal Council items (villages). We will never have a category to any Wikipedia. ⟨ Agios Mamas (Q516882)    ⟩ executive body (P208) ⟨ Communal Council of Agios Mamas (Q54877972)    ⟩ Xaris333 (talk) 15:06, 10 June 2018 (UTC) Then I wouldn't worry too much about the constraint. Not sure if another more appropriate property exists than P208, or if P208 is just really badly defined & constrained. --Tagishsimon (talk) 15:17, 10 June 2018 (UTC) I removed the constraint as it doesn't make sense anymore (it might have made sense in the early days of Wikidata). ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 20:09, 15 June 2018 (UTC) City as an administrative territorial entity and sister city ⟨ city (Q515)    ⟩ subclass of (P279) ⟨ administrative territorial entity (Q56061)    ⟩ Is a city \"a territorial entity for administration purposes, with or without its own local government\" I think this is wrong. Municipality is subclass of political territorial entity (Q1048835), not the city. Sometimes are the same, so we have one item. Sometimes are not the same:For example,Thessaloniki (Q17151) is a city which includes many municipalities. Thessaloniki Municipality (Q6627746) is the main municipality, but only the one municpality of the city. It is controlling only a part of the city.The administrative territorial entity in that case are (by administrative level): 1) Central Macedonia (Q17152) 2) Thessaloniki Metropolitan Unit (Q210176) 3) Thessaloniki Municipality (Q6627746) Second example: Cyprus is divided to 6 district (1st administrative level). Each district have municipalites and communal councils (villages) (2nd administrative level). Cities are not administrative territorial entity. Each city have many municipalities.The administrative territorial entity in that case are (by administrative level): 1) Cyprus (Q229) 2) Limassol District (Q59150) (there are 5 more districts) 3) Limassol Municipality (Q28870916) (there are more 5 municipalities and 106 communal councils in the district). The 6 municipalities are forming the city (more or less). But the city of Limassol Limassol (Q185632) is not an administrative territorial entity. I have these thoughts because of twinned administrative body (P190). Each municipality or community (the authorities of them) make an agreement with a twin municipality or a twin community. Not the city each self. But this, is not for all cases. In some cases, in some countries, \"all city=one municipality\".Maybe I am wrong. I am confused. Xaris333 (talk) 20:34, 11 June 2018 (UTC) You are right, the term \"city\" has two meanings - one is the human settlement in a purely geographic sense, the other is the political administrative unit. In Wikipedia and thus also here, whenever possible the two meanings are clustered together - simply because in most cases they are practically identical. This is one of problems with the import from geonames via the Cebuano Wikipedia - in geonames the \"human settlement\" and \"political unit\" are always separated, which created a lot of duplicate items here. And thus its right that for the sister city property it should be limited to political units, but not only local governments - in Thailand also provinces have done such partnerships. Ahoerstemeier (talk) 21:29, 11 June 2018 (UTC) This is one of several instances where ceb.wp is causing problems WMF-wide. What they are doing is a nuisance. —Justin (koavf)❤T☮C☺M☯ 22:49, 11 June 2018 (UTC) It can also be tricky when there's a distinction between an administrative body and the territory administered by that body. Sometimes there are two entities in Wikidata, sometimes only one (usually for the territory). A territory itself doesn't really have administrative powers, it's the thing that's administered. Ghouston (talk) 02:59, 12 June 2018 (UTC) The fact is that there is always a distinction between an administrative body and the territory administered by that body, according to the point of view of each discipline. Are the boundaries of the city up to the last buildings, or at the boundaries of the administrative body? (which may include surrounding farmlands, forests, lakes...) Is the population living in the city, or living at the area administered by the local administrative body (so, a similar question would be \"where in which we put the population, since the censuses reference the population by administrative bodies and not by cities, towns, and villages\"). Going a level up, are the wars or treaties between countries or between the governments of the countries?The point is that municipalities or any administrative entity are not self-sufficient. The municipalities represent their city, but the boundaries of a municipality and a city are never identical if we see it positively (for example, if we think the city extends to the last houses). There are different types of settlements from a human geography point of view, there are various relations between the city center and the suburbs (or if one wants to see it administratively, the central municipality and the regional ones), the surrounding settlements even when they are in a different administrative unit have a direct connection with the city, etc... In essence, the institution is referred to as such; between \"cities\" and not municipalities. Sometimes linguistic or formal conventions create ambiguities, but it is natural (self-evident) that in order for twinning to take place that would need action from their representatives (the municipalities) -like in treaties between countries, signed by their governments.If it is considered correct that eg. if it is not Kavala (Q187352) who was twinned with Nuremberg (Q2090), then it should also apply to the second part: then it would be Kavala Municipality (Q12282294) and the \"Municipality of Nuremberg\" (no item). Are not Thessaloniki (Q17151) and Melbourne (Q3141), but the Thessaloniki Municipality (Q6627746) and the City of Melbourne (Q1919098)? (only the center, with 3% of the city's population) According to formalities, yes. These are the institutions that have signed the co-operation agreements. On the other hand, however, we see that the Municipalities themselves report twinning with other cities, not with other municipalities. That is humanistically correct, as the structure and culture of cities are generally dependent on its center, substantially or even as symbols. Thessaloniki and Melbourne where twinned because more than 152000 Greeks live in Melbourne. A number much larger than the population of the whole \"City of Melbourne\". It is obvious that in many cases the political administrative unit of the city centre or the greater area acts on behalf of the city. These actions may be symbolic or substantial but the do represent the city. Another example would be the twinning of New York City (Q60) and London (Q84). London is not the administrative body, Greater London (Q23306) is. Sticking with unecessary formalism, would mean that we would turn \"twinned cities\" to \"twinned administrative bodies\". -Geraki (talk) 07:34, 12 June 2018 (UTC) \"Twinned administrative bodies\" would probably be more accurate, but administrative bodies often have delusions of grandeur. I once moved all the Wellington, NZ sister cities to Wellington City (Q47037646), since that's the territory of the body that organized them, Wellington City Council (Q601800). They don't have anything to do with the other cities in the Wellington (Q23661) urban area such as Porirua (Q1015773), which has a different set of sister cities. Ghouston (talk) 08:57, 12 June 2018 (UTC) Any suggestions to solve the problem? Xaris333 (talk) 12:15, 12 June 2018 (UTC) The claim ⟨ city (Q515)    ⟩ subclass of (P279) ⟨ administrative territorial entity (Q56061)    ⟩ isn't there at the moment. It seems to come and go. I'd suggest pointing out on its Talk page why it shouldn't be there. Ghouston (talk) 06:56, 13 June 2018 (UTC) My suggestion is to use city (Q515) with instance of (P31) for all cities, plus to use subclass of (P279) with administrative territorial entity (Q56061) (or a subclass of it) if the city and the municipality are the same thing (item). If we have separated items, then we must use only city (Q515) with instance of (P31). For the municipality we will use subclass of (P279) with administrative territorial entity (Q56061). This will affect some properties like twinned administrative body (P190) (I rename it to \"twinned administrative body\"), we have to move the statements from the city to the municipality item. Xaris333 (talk) 17:14, 13 June 2018 (UTC) For what it's worth, for the U.S. we have city in the United States (Q1093829) for a \"city\" in the legal/administrative sense; in many states, this can apply to some small settled places that are by no means a city (Q515). I suspect something parallel applies in other countries. - Jmabel (talk) 04:12, 14 June 2018 (UTC) Indeed, the solution identified by Xaris333 makes sense: Any twinning twinned administrative body (P190) is between administrative entities. So this must be reflected in the Wikidata items of such entities (municipalities or other) and not in the \"cities\" which might be a much different thing. I also agree with the differentiation of cities which are exactly equal to administrative entities (to use subclass of (P279) with administrative territorial entity (Q56061) in these cases). --FocalPoint (talk) 16:02, 16 June 2018 (UTC) Swedish verb mula (Q10590035) is a Swedish verb. It seemed natural to me to create a sitelink to https://sv.wiktionary.org/wiki/mula (via wiki=sv, value=\"mula\" under Wiktionary) but I got a message telling me basically not to do that. Seems odd to me; what is correct policy? - Jmabel (talk) 05:57, 14 June 2018 (UTC) The main issue is that items about words are not supposed in the Q namespace in Wikidata but in the newly created Lexeme/Form namespaces. Maybe the solution is to create a proper item for 'mula' in those namespaces and then add the link from sv-wiki to the newly created item and delete mula (Q10590035). ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 11:35, 14 June 2018 (UTC) @ChristianKl: So does that mean that Wikipedia articles about words shouldn't have corresponding Wikidata items, the way all other articles (even disambiguations) should? That seems a bit awkward. - Jmabel (talk) 19:51, 14 June 2018 (UTC) @Jmabel: Why do you think it's awkward to to link such articles to a lexeme or sense instead of an item in the Q-namespace? ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 10:55, 16 June 2018 (UTC) @ChristianKl: I think it's awkward either to ask Wikipedians who may know almost nothing about Commons to have to do things differently for a class of articles that have no special distinction within the site they are familiar with, or to ask a bot to be able to make a distinction such as that the article \"African American\" is about an ethnic group, but the article \"Negro\" is about a word. - Jmabel (talk) 16:57, 16 June 2018 (UTC) Same item with a property Is there a constrain for using, with a property, only an item just one time?

Xaris333 (talk) 22:39, 15 June 2018 (UTC) Your description is ambiguous and bold characters are not likely to help. Can you give examples of item states where the constraint would trigger a violation, and examples of item states where the constraint would be satisfied? − Pintoch (talk) 07:34, 16 June 2018 (UTC) ⟨ Real Madrid CF (Q8682)    ⟩ participant in (P1344) ⟨ 2017–18 La Liga (Q24529775)    ⟩ Ι can add this statement more than one time.

Do we need a separate property for these; if not, how should such URLs be represented? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 09:55, 12 June 2018 (UTC) To add my 2cents, formatter URI for RDF resource (P1921) is specific for patterns for RDF resources URIs and so imho could not be use to link to XML documents. It would be very interesting to create a new URI formatter that would be named something \"URI pattern for machine-readable representation\" that would link to JSON/XML/turtle... description of the connected entities. It would be also useful in the RDF use case when the resource URIs do not properly redirect to an RDf document describing the resource when an RDF content type is requested.

Very confusuing; you may need something two or three times this long to express what you actually mean to ask, an if there is a different language where you can express it more clearly (e.g. German), feel free. - Jmabel (talk) 21:31, 18 June 2018 (UTC) There are some statistics about Wikidata usage in Wikipedia, see grafana. But they are not very fine graded, for example they do not distiguish between statements which are used to create maintenance categories and statements which are displayed. There is also Category:Templates using data from Wikidata (Q11985372) which lists some templates that use data from Wikidata. --Pasleim (talk) 21:48, 18 June 2018 (UTC) Park designed by... Right now, constraints on designed by (P287) and movement (P135) have a type constraint that gives a warning if used on instances of urban park (Q22746). Most urban parks are works of landscape design, and so have a designer; some are clearly identified with a movement. For example: ⟨ Freeway Park (Q5501246)    ⟩ designed by (P287) ⟨ Lawrence Halprin (Q2756604)    ⟩ ⟨ Freeway Park (Q5501246)    ⟩ movement (P135) ⟨ brutalist architecture (Q994776)    ⟩ I think the constraint should be altered to consider these statements appropriate, but I'm not sure how best to do this. Perhaps garden (Q1107656) (of which Q22746 is a subclass) should be considered a subclass of creative work (Q17537576)? That would solve it, I believe- Jmabel (talk) 03:59, 19 June 2018 (UTC) A proposed course of action for dealing with cebwiki/svwiki geographic duplicates A series of deletion requests by @Joseagush:, my merging of Wikidata items for French communes, and seeing @Exec8: performing full-content replacements recently on cebwiki made me wonder if we needed a codified procedure for dealing with geographic duplicates from cebwiki/svwiki. As a result I proposed the following in response to the aforementioned deletion requests (and I hope @Lsj: and other Wikidata admins can opine on this as well): Visit the GeoNames pages for the two Wikidata items (linked from the GeoNames ID on both Wikidata items). Verify that the two GeoNames items actually do refer to the exact same place down to the same level of administrative division1. Open a GeoNames account if you do not have one already. Move any appropriate information from the less accurate2 GeoNames item into the more accurate GeoNames item and delete the less accurate GeoNames item (I don't recall offhand if a merge capability exists there). Go to cebwiki and svwiki and replace the entire content of the page corresponding to the less accurate GeoNames item with \"#REDIRECT [[{name}]]\" (where \"{name}\" should of course be substituted with the name of the page on that wiki corresponding to the more accurate GeoNames item). Delete the sitelinks for the page corresponding to the less accurate GeoNames item on those sitelinks' associated Wikidata item, delete the statement for that Wikidata item's GeoNames ID, and merge that Wikidata item with the more accurate GeoNames item's Wikidata item. I imagine this would be a good course of action for those people who frequently get ticked at the plethora of cebwiki/svwiki-only geographic Wikidata items. @Abductive, Ahoerstemeier: from a recently archived June discussion, @Jura1, Pigsonthewing, Hsarrazin, Liuxinyu970226, YMS, GZWDer: from a March complaint. (I will most likely ping folks from the two discussions archived here at some point.) I say this because I have noticed many conflations of Indian administrative divisions, such as taluka/village or tehsil/census town for example, on other wikis. I use 'accurate' instead of 'detailed' here because the French commune GeoNames items imported by INSEE have geoshapes that the GeoNames items imported by World Gazetteer do not.Mahir256 (talk) 16:42, 18 June 2018 (UTC) Keep in mind that occasionally the administrative excludes the settlement its named after for example Q1002828 is not in Q21347409. There should still be 2 items then, I don't know if France has any like this though. Lucywood (talk) 18:04, 18 June 2018 (UTC) Sounds fine. No doubt there are some real duplicates and some erroneous duplicates. Abductive (talk) 18:15, 18 June 2018 (UTC) If you like to proceed that way, this is fine for me. I'm not sure it scales though, but I'd love to see if it did. I don't think it's suitable as a general suggestion on how to proceed to other contributors: Wikidata should be editable without creating accounts at other Wikimedia websites or third party websites. Quality improvements at Wikidata (or lack thereof) should be possible without correcting errors everywhere else. There are couple of possible approaches that have been identified in earlier discussions of the problem. In the meantime, I suppose most people just try to skip cebwiki/svwiki only items. --- Jura 07:07, 19 June 2018 (UTC) I think we should also ping cebwiki sysops @Bentong Isles, Harvzs, Jordz, Josefwintzent Libot: and post the Swedish translation of this section to sv:Wikipedia:Bybrunnen (@Ainali: can you please help us?) IMHO the GeoNames datas aren't wrong, the wrong is that Lsj himself doesn't know how to insert data links to the existing items (or especially don't know how to find existing articles to add em). --Liuxinyu970226 (talk) 07:59, 19 June 2018 (UTC) To my experience, we have several problems: duplication of administrative subdivision and populated places - something done by geonames, but (usually) not by Wikipedias. In some cases this is handy, e.g. when a municipality consists of several distinct populated places, then Wikipedia (usually) omits the one named same-named as the municipality. Elevation data imported from ceb often wrong due to inaccurate coordinates, and even worse often imported here without adding imported from Wikimedia project (P143). Especially inselberg (Q1139493)-like hills are affected. Items imported by bot, but without the coordinates, thus making it even more difficult to spot the duplication. Each of these points need different action, as in principle the geonames database isn't that bad as it seems from the recurring discussions here. Ahoerstemeier (talk) 08:33, 19 June 2018 (UTC) Death in episode number... How to better model that a character was killed in specific episode/book/film of series? I use manner of death (P1196) with qualifier described by source (P1343). Or better as reference? Or some other property? And how to distinguish from the case when a death of the character was described in episode (as a flashback, not a main storyline)? --Infovarius (talk) 11:20, 19 June 2018 (UTC) Infovarius, in general you can use stated in (P248) as a reference to indicate the work where a fictional event is mentioned (both as part of the main storyline and as part of a (in-narrative true) story within this work). Sometimes present in work (P1441) is used as a qualifier to express that a certain event takes places in a certain work, but mostly to restrict in-narrative facts to a certain story-world (e.g. if Dracula has a son in one work but not in others). So this one would also not be useful to emphasize that a certain event takes place in the main storyline of the work. It seems to me that start period (P3415)/end period (P3416) as qualifiers could work for this purpose, if one accepts the idea of a storyline being a period (see the property proposal). - Valentina.Anitnelav (talk) 18:24, 19 June 2018 (UTC) Wikidata weekly summary #317 Here's your quick overview of what has been happening around Wikidata over the last week.

For example: Does Wikidata know that Ankara (Q3640) belongs to Asia (Q48)? As far as I see Wikidata does know that Ankara (Q3640) belongs to Turkey (Q43), but Turkey (Q43) belongs to two continents. --Jobu0101 (talk) 19:11, 19 June 2018 (UTC) @Jobu0101: This should ideally be inferred from the continent Ankara Province (Q2297724) is on (contrast with the continent Edirne Province (Q83102)—also in Turkey (Q43)—is on).

Do you also know the answer to my continent related question here? --Jobu0101 (talk) 19:58, 19 June 2018 (UTC) This is not limited to the continent property. There are also properties like located in time zone (P421) or official language (P37) added to every village, even they are same all up the hierarchy to the country. As there is nothing like a calculated statement within Wikidata (not sure about what's possible with Lua in Infoboxes) we probably have to live with the redundancy.

AFAIK mandatory qualifier requirements are in the property domain, and so we find P166 has a property constraint in the form of a mandatory qualifier constraint requirement for P585. Presumably the thinking is that all awards must have a temporal property. Is there anything especial about Q2085100 over and above this normal expectation? --Tagishsimon (talk) 22:49, 11 June 2018 (UTC) No nothing special With Q2085100, just chosen as an example. The answer that in general the requirement are in the property is fine with me. Maybe I just can use Wikidata usage instructions (P2559) saying This item must have P585 as qualifier. Pmt (talk) 23:59, 11 June 2018 (UTC) Sounds reasonable. --Tagishsimon (talk) 00:13, 12 June 2018 (UTC) We don't have item based mandatory qualifiers. In this case I also don't see why one would be warrented as it would effectively say: \"There are no serious sources that mention that a person received this award but that don't say when they received it\" ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 11:17, 14 June 2018 (UTC) \"Award received\" has a constraint \"Point in time\". So I do not understand the issue. Also a constraint does not mean that we always know the associated date. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 16:04, 21 June 2018 (UTC) is part of a particular cuisine How do I indicate that a dish or an ingredient is part of a particular cuisine? Thanks, GerardM (talk) 12:10, 14 June 2018 (UTC) It's sometimes done with part of (P361) like on Valtellina Casera (Q782709). Ghouston (talk) 12:33, 14 June 2018 (UTC) There's also indigenous to (P2341) if you're associating the dish to a specific people, location or culture. - PKM (talk) 19:33, 14 June 2018 (UTC) part of (P361) seems to me to be a little awkward for things like this, because it gives a warning if you don't have the reciprocal has part(s) (P527). It seems to me like we should have an alternative for part of (P361) that doesn't expect that sort of explicit reciprocation. - Jmabel (talk) 19:53, 14 June 2018 (UTC) In this case, the inverse can just be added to the cuisine item. But there has been a discussion about whether the inverse constraint should be required, and it was even deleted for a while but reinstated. Property_talk:P361#Removing_inverse_constraint.

Can anyone suggest some, please? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 10:17, 16 June 2018 (UTC) See source of https://www.obi.de, https://www.apple.com and quite a few other large websites. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 14:59, 16 June 2018 (UTC) @Lydia Pintscher (WMDE): Thank you. That's interesting; I hadn't envisaged use for the subject of the site as a whole. What about examples for individual page subjects? I also note that OBI uses https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q300518 (\"https\"; \"wiki\") while Apple uses http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q312 (\"http\"; \"entity\"). Am I correct in assuming that \"https\" and \"entity\" are preferred? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 17:54, 16 June 2018 (UTC) The Apple one is more \"correct\" because that is the URI of the concept that is also linked in the sidebar of any item. I have not come across sites using it for individual page subjects but that doesn't mean much. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 18:38, 16 June 2018 (UTC) I'm still seeking examples, at page-level specificity, if anyone has them - someone must be doing this, surely? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 10:53, 20 June 2018 (UTC) Like data.bnf.fr (see \"Pages équivalentes\" section) and SUDOC (\"Autres identifiants\"), for instance? Nomen ad hoc (talk) 17:00, 20 June 2018 (UTC). Thank you, but the markup in the former is (for an English speaker): <a href=\"http://wikidata.org/entity/Q535\">Equivalent record in Wikidata :</a>, with no semantic component. I did find one example, which I documented at Wikidata:Wikidata for authority control#MusicBrainz. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 21:34, 20 June 2018 (UTC) \"owned by\" I'm finding it very difficult to see the line between owned by (P127) and parent organization (P749). Some cases are clear (a work of art uses the former, a subsidiary company uses the latter) but which applies, for example, to a branch library such as Capitol Hill Branch Library (Q48807472)? - Jmabel (talk) 01:22, 19 June 2018 (UTC) The property proposal for parent organization (P749) at Wikidata:Property_proposal/Archive/12#P749 gives some information. Ghouston (talk) 08:02, 19 June 2018 (UTC) Yes, \"Wikidata:Property_proposal/Archive/12#P749 gives some information,\" but it fails to answer my question as to which is more appropriate here. - Jmabel (talk) 16:03, 19 June 2018 (UTC) I would not use <owned by> here. Instead, I would make Seattle Public Library (Q7442157) <instance of> library network (Q28324850) and use <part of/has part> relations between the system and the branch libraries. However, <parent organization> seems perfectly fine since a library system is clearly an organization (and I would mark Seattle Public Library as a library system in either case). - PKM (talk) 17:58, 19 June 2018 (UTC) Thanks, edited accordingly. - Jmabel (talk) 16:06, 20 June 2018 (UTC) Actually for library systems I would just use \"has part\" and \"part of\", the way we do for museums that are part of larger institutions. Jane023 (talk) 09:40, 21 June 2018 (UTC) Elevation above sea levelWhat can it possibly mean to have the (current) statement⟨ San Juan Islands (Q1196315)    ⟩ elevation above sea level (P2044) ⟨ 23 metre ⟩ The islands, obviously, have a minimum elevation of 0, and their highest point is the peak of Mount Constitution (Q6920229), at 734 metres. Is there some useful way to express that in San Juan Islands (Q1196315)? Because the current statement is like saying \"part of this house is 34 cm off the ground.\" - Jmabel (talk) 23:43, 20 June 2018 (UTC) For extended geographical entities this really makes no sense - then we need either a completely new datatype to encode a range of values, or with what is currently available could add the highest and lowest elevation with the qualifier applies to part (P518) set to highest point (Q3393392) or lowest point (Q35691103). Take a look of how I adjusted it in Aachen (Q1017), that way I think it makes sense, including to describe which place was chosen as the random median point within the entity. Ahoerstemeier (talk) 08:33, 21 June 2018 (UTC) PS - you know highest point (P610)? I have added that now both to the archipelago as well as the corresponding island. Ahoerstemeier (talk) 12:29, 21 June 2018 (UTC) @Ahoerstemeier: If that is the right way to do it, then there is a constraint that should be changed: right now, this gets a warning that \"coordinate location is not a valid qualifier for elevation above sea level.\" - Jmabel (talk) 15:15, 21 June 2018 (UTC) Yeah, I noticed that warning. The coordinates are IMHO useful, especially if the extreme points cannot become items to be linked with highest point (P610)/lowest point (P1589). Sometimes the highest point is a mountain peak, but especially the lowest point is often just a place along a river, or even a coast line. I have no idea if there is any recommended way to handle these, it's just what I came up with.
