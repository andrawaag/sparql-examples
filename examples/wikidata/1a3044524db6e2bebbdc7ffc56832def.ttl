I saw on the Wikiproject Music page that it's possible to \"Use performer (P175) to list all the performers with instrument (P1303) as a qualifier to say which instrument each performer played on that recording.\" I'd be interested in either performers with instruments on a recording or a release. But I haven't been able to find an example query showing how to do this nor have I been able to construct one myself.Using the Beatles as an example, I am guessing I want to look at a track and not a song. I see I can get the composer and producer as properties, and I can return the band as performer, but have had no luck in my attempts to get the personnel roles. But I'm also not confident how to know if the entities will even have roles. I've tried with a few different tracks & releases but don't know if it's my query or the entities I'm looking at. Both? Any help much appreciated.Query: # personnel and instruments played on a recording

} @Nikoladelikatesla: So a couple of things to say about your version. If you want to reach for ps: and pq: values, you generally start with a p:P175, not a wdt:P175. And then the ?performer statement ... would just be ps:P175. That they're a human is neither here nor there. Here's a working query. It's actually written pretty much in reverse order, since the scarcest values are instruments used as qualifiers to performer. There are > 460k uses of P175, so queries involving this property will probably have to have some other conditions to decrease the result set, such as country, or genre, or whatever. # personnel and instruments played on a recording

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 19:56, 1 April 2021 (UTC) Thank you very much Tagishsimon! This is exactly it. I'm cleary very hazy on the qualifier stuff, need to spend some more time studying it. Appreciate the fast response. -- Nikoladelikatesla 20:07, 1 April 2021 (UTC) @Nikoladelikatesla: This section of the WDQS tutorial is quite good on qualifiers; and the datamodel for an item tries to convey how data is strung together with predicates. (Start at the item bubble; wdt: takes you to a simple value, but is otherwise a dead end. p: takes you to a statement which allows you to look at ps:, pq:, prov:wasDerivedFrom (which leads to pr: ) and other good stuff. --Tagishsimon (talk) 20:17, 1 April 2021 (UTC) Count identifiers with exceptions Hi all! Starting from the following banal query SELECT ?n WHERE { wd:Q11922067 wikibase:identifiers ?n . }
 Try it! I would like to ask you if the two following improvements are possible: obtain a query asking to count, in Philumenus (Q11922067), all the external identifiers only once (i.e. counting P8034 one time instead of three times, P227 one time instead of two times etc.) obtain a query asking to count, in Philumenus (Q11922067), all the external identifiers except one or more specific properties, e.g. excluding all the values of P214 and P1871 from count Thank you very much! --Epìdosis 07:23, 1 April 2021 (UTC) Items used: Philumenus (Q11922067)   SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?wdt) as ?count) ?n
