I have no idea how to do this, but could be useful in the future in any case for me to learn it. Can you please show to me how to encode this request?--Alexmar983 (talk) 17:57, 2 November 2018 (UTC) @Alexmar983: One approach - presuming you want a table with one column per language - is below. We find ?items in the Q181175 class tree with wdt:P31/wdt:P279* and then use a series of optional requirements that ask for the rdfs:labal each filtered to just a single language. Optional is used since some items may not have labels in a particular language and would not otherwise appear. We could take a different approach to produce a 2 or 3 column output of itemnumber, label, language ... but that's very slightly more complicated so I'll duck that for now. You can add Englist as ?en / \"en\" should you need it. select ?item ?es ?pt ?ro ?cs ?pl ?ru ?ar ?fa ?hi ?zh ?ja ?ms where
{
  ?item wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q181175 . # The item is an instance or subclass of a scalar physical quantity 
  optional {?item rdfs:label ?es . filter(lang(?es)=\"es\") } # get the label in whatever language - Spanish, in this case
  optional {?item rdfs:label ?pt . filter(lang(?pt)=\"pt\") }
  optional {?item rdfs:label ?ro . filter(lang(?ro)=\"ro\") }
  optional {?item rdfs:label ?cs . filter(lang(?cs)=\"cs\") }
  optional {?item rdfs:label ?pl . filter(lang(?pl)=\"pl\") }
  optional {?item rdfs:label ?ru . filter(lang(?ru)=\"ru\") }
  optional {?item rdfs:label ?ar . filter(lang(?ar)=\"ar\") }
  optional {?item rdfs:label ?fa . filter(lang(?fa)=\"fa\") }
  optional {?item rdfs:label ?hi . filter(lang(?hi)=\"hi\") }
  optional {?item rdfs:label ?zh . filter(lang(?zh)=\"zh\") }
  optional {?item rdfs:label ?ja . filter(lang(?ja)=\"ja\") }
  optional {?item rdfs:label ?ms . filter(lang(?ms)=\"ms\") }

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 18:32, 2 November 2018 (UTC) Tagishsimon that's good, he has an account he seldomly uses, I have asked him to insert some of the missing ones when he find them.--Alexmar983 (talk) 19:05, 2 November 2018 (UTC) Thanks Alexmar983. I suspect he'll find that difficult, unless you give him advice on the Babel Extension, which it looks like you have implemented on your account; without it, the user interface will not give him the facility to add in more than a few languages. --Tagishsimon (talk) 19:14, 2 November 2018 (UTC) You are right Tagishsimon about the extension, I'll tell him. he wants to learn about wikidata in any case.--Alexmar983 (talk) 19:55, 2 November 2018 (UTC) @Alexmar983: You can use the query select ?item where { ?item wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q181175 . } in the Tabernacle tool (with a 'Label' column with languages \"es,pt,ro,cs,pl,ru,ar,fa,hi,zh,ja,ms\") so that you can also edit the labels for those items in one place.
