Eg. \"Member of the 16th Parliament of the United Kingdom\" is a subclass of 'Member of Parliament'.

 Try it!  Probably lowest QIDs or whatever was loaded into the server database first, possibly similar to what you get when using SAMPLE(). The result might even vary from one server to another. In any case, I don't think it's fairly random. --- Jura 08:33, 6 July 2019 (UTC) Categories with the same label Hi!

It also exclude articles with imagemaps.
