Edoderoo (talk) 13:16, 8 June 2019 (UTC) And this one: done by script: code I got this confirmed (by email).

Edgars2007 (talk) 14:30, 14 June 2019 (UTC) Replace Art Institute of Chicago (Q239303) with something else Items used: Art Institute of Chicago (Q239303)   Properties used: stated in (P248)   SELECT * { ?item ?p ?st . ?st prov:wasDerivedFrom/pr:P248 wd:Q239303 } LIMIT 1262 Try it!When used in references, Art Institute of Chicago (Q239303) currently generates a constraint violation, as it's not a publication. Can this be replaced with something better? Above a query with the ca 1200 current uses. --- Jura 07:33, 20 June 2019 (UTC) I suggest to create a new Q-item that will be of the right type (catalog/gallary/whatever) that will replace these occurences. I understand the constraint, as it is a museum, and indeed not a publication of that museum. Replacing the items will then be a matter of writing a small script. Edoderoo (talk) 07:38, 20 June 2019 (UTC) Sounds good. --- Jura 07:54, 20 June 2019 (UTC) If you create a suitable catalog item, I could do this as I have such scripts available. --MisterSynergy (talk) 08:20, 20 June 2019 (UTC) Sure: Q64732761. Thanks for your help. --- Jura 08:32, 20 June 2019 (UTC) Task completed --MisterSynergy (talk) 09:40, 20 June 2019 (UTC)  I think that this discussion is resolved and can be archived.

SELECT * { ?item p:P1871/prov:wasDerivedFrom/pr:P143 wd:Q1127581 } LIMIT 47347 Try it!In the above, I think Q1127581 can be replaced with Q60909659. --- Jura 11:44, 20 June 2019 (UTC) Additionally, imported from Wikimedia project (P143) should be replaced by stated in (P248); most (or all of them) were imported by User:Reinheitsgebot a while ago. I could do this as well with one edit per item. Opinions? --MisterSynergy (talk) 11:59, 20 June 2019 (UTC) Agree. Forgot to mention that. --- Jura 12:03, 20 June 2019 (UTC) Okay; I am running another similar job first which I prepared three weeks ago (13.000 edits), and then this one will start... --MisterSynergy (talk) 12:27, 20 June 2019 (UTC) Finished --MisterSynergy (talk) 10:05, 21 June 2019 (UTC) Items used: CERL Thesaurus (Q60909659)   , Consortium of European Research Libraries (Q1127581)   Properties used: CERL Thesaurus ID (P1871)   , stated in (P248)   # New wd:Q60909659
SELECT * { ?item p:P1871/prov:wasDerivedFrom/pr:P248 wd:Q1127581 } LIMIT 1070 Try it! @MisterSynergy:. Thanks for your help. I just noticed that some already used P248, but with Q1127581. Would you kindly update these too? --- Jura 10:57, 21 June 2019 (UTC) Sure, but it is probably worth to generalize, right? --MisterSynergy (talk) 12:54, 21 June 2019 (UTC) Yep. As we don't have a special qualifier for quaternary sources ;) --- Jura 13:13, 21 June 2019 (UTC) Finished again --MisterSynergy (talk) 17:53, 21 June 2019 (UTC) I think that this discussion is resolved and can be archived.
