MargaretRDonald (talk) 09:20, 1 November 2020 (UTC) Weird time-out in a query Here's a query that is giving me weird time-outs, and I don't understand why, given that with very small changes I can make it not time out (but also not give me the results I want). The query is work-in-progress, towards plotting how Scottish church ministers moved from one job to another. The key thing I'm trying to get here are the coordinates on each line for their previous job, and the coordinates for their current job; so that I then would be able to plot a line between them.The code below times out.But weirdly, if I comment out the lines giving me ?form_lat and ?from_lon then everything works (tinyurl.com/yxbhcm37) though of course I don't get the 'from' coords. Interestingly, it is not the line ?from p:P625 ?from_coords_stmt which seems to cause a problem, but rather any subsequent use of ?from_coords_stmt, eg even ?from_coords_stmt ps:P625 ?from_coords (tinyurl.com/yxgjyoue ; cf also tinyurl.com/y2kz9uts). I don't understand this.Also, if I remove the OPTIONAL from the join in the %ministers_moves block, then the problem goes away. tinyurl.com/yy54r62r (But then I don't get a line in the output for the minister's first job). For the ministers' first jobs, with the OPTIONAL, the COALESCE should give ?from the same value as ?place. And the query can find the coordinates for ?place with no problem. So why is it failing for ?from ?This kind of time-out is the sort of thing that could happen from a typo, if the typo led to a line with a triple with unbound variables. But I don't think I've made a typo, or got unbound variables that I can see. Can anybody spot or explain what might be going on here? Jheald (talk) 19:56, 31 October 2020 (UTC)Query: SELECT DISTINCT

With a little bit of work I had the code of looking up the airport from its ICAO code working.(https://w.wiki/jxo) However I am having difficulties trying to get the city where the airport is located.located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) looks promising, but a few attempts reveals that it would not only return the city of the airport, but also the province, the state, the municipality, etc. For example, RJAA (Narita International Airport near Tokyo, Japan) has both Narita (the city) and Chiba Perfecture listed there, KUNV (University Park Airport in State College, Pennsylvania, USA) only has Pensylvania listed, and ZSQD (Qingdao Liuting International Airport in Qingdao, Shandong, China) only has Chengyang District (one level lower than city) listed.I came with two solutions but failed to put the codes together.The first solution is to keep using the wdt:P131 and set up a filter to remove anything that is not a city. SELECT ?airport ?airportLabel ?airportIn ?airportInLabel ?airportInType ?airportInTypeLabel WHERE {
  ?airport wdt:P239 \"RJAA\".
  { ?airport wdt:P131 ?airportIn. }
  { ?airportIn wdt:P31 ?airportInType. }
  FILTER(EXISTS { ?airportInType wdt:P279 wd:Q515. })
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }
}
 Try it! It only works with RJAA as it has Narita P31 Q494721 (instance of City of Japan) and Q494721 P279 Q515 (subclass of City). It did not work with ZGGG which has Guangzhou P31 Q515 (instance of City), nor did it work with those airports that only has P131 with districts. Of course I can also manually add those instance of cities into each airport's wikidata entry but that is likely going to take a lot of effort and introduce some redundant info (such as RJAA wdt:P131 Narita wdt:P31 ((city of Japan) AND (city))).The second solution is to take the coordinate of the airport and to do a query to find out which city this coordinate belongs to. I am afraid that it may take way too much resources and I have no idea about how to write a query for such.Please let me know if you have any other thoughts on how I can build a query that takes an ICAO airport code and returns the city the airport is located at.Staph aureus (talk) 17:52, 3 November 2020 (UTC) It really depends what you are looking for. Maybe place served by transport hub (P931) suits you better? If there are multiple values, query the closest or the most populous one. --- Jura 18:18, 3 November 2020 (UTC) Before I may be able to help, I need to know what you mean by \"City of the Airport\". I live in Denmark and none of the Danish airports that I know of are located in a city, but somewhere in the country outside any city. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 21:34, 3 November 2020 (UTC) To make things simpler, I am assuming that every airport, as a building, has its address, and every address has a component of \"City\" or its local equivalent. That is what I am looking for. For Kansai International Airport, I am happy to take Izumisano city instead of the nearby Osaka city. For Vancouver International Airport, I am also happy to take Richmond instead of Vancouver. However if this is more difficult than taking the \"largest city nearby\" then I think I can accept either one. --Staph aureus (talk) 23:45, 3 November 2020 (UTC) Actually Jura's idea of using place served by transport hub (P931) is quite brilliant. Could not believe I missed out such a good property when I was staring at those airports. SELECT ?airport ?airportLabel ?airportIn ?airportInLabel WHERE {
  ?airport wdt:P239 \"RJAA\".
  { ?airport wdt:P931 ?airportIn. }
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }
}
 Try it! It works like a charm now. Thanks for your help. --Staph aureus (talk) 00:00, 4 November 2020 (UTC) @Staph aureus: named after (P138) could be another option. I added a quite a few some time ago (adding more precise P131 seemed less interesting to me). If it's a place, it's usually similar to place served by transport hub (P931) or the other place you were looking for. Querying the distance between these finds a few exceptions. --- Jura 07:22, 4 November 2020 (UTC) Is it possible to list people with items created in the last 12 months? #Mujeres mexicanas

} Try it!The above gives you an idea when they were created. However, it could be that P27=Q96 was added only later.Q88888888 was created at the end of March, so anything more recent would be new since. --- Jura 21:04, 3 November 2020 (UTC) A relative simple approach is find an item created on the limit date. Remove the \"Q\" from the item names and convert the number part to integers. Any items with greater integers than the item from the limit date are created later than that. It is also possible to get the exact creation time for any item with a precision of 1 second by using a MWAPI call but it is limited how many items you can query about in one query without causing timeout. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 21:48, 3 November 2020 (UTC) I would agree that the easiest solution here is to use the QID as a proxy for age, with any ID past your cut-off being new. There may be a few weird cases where an item was created before, a duplicate was created after, and the old item was merged into the new one - but this situation is very unusual. Andrew Gray (talk) 22:52, 3 November 2020 (UTC) @Hispano76: So for example if you only want items created later than Q88000000 from 19 Mar 2020 insert this filter in your code: FILTER (xsd:integer(SUBSTR(STR(?item),33)) > 88000000)
 You can adjust the number as you like to get the right cut off date. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 07:57, 4 November 2020 (UTC) gsbbox equivalent Hi.

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 21:06, 2 November 2020 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: A little tip for another time. You can extract ?item directly from the MWAPI service by using the predicate wikibase:apiOutputItem that automatically converts the title to an IRI for an item. That will make query many times faster. Instead of the normally expensive REGEX function you can also use the simpler FILTER STRENDS(?itemLabel, \"Ruth\") but I doubt it will very noticeable in this case. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 06:59, 3 November 2020 (UTC) Isn't regex usually quicker than the less technical functions (strends, strstarts, ..)? --- Jura 07:18, 3 November 2020 (UTC) That depends on how they are implemented. If STRENDS and STRSTARTS for instance just are wrappers for REGEX, you are right. But they will always be faster if you write a specialized optimized implementation for them. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 07:40, 3 November 2020 (UTC) Well, at Wikidata Query Service. --- Jura 08:50, 3 November 2020 (UTC) Depending on whether you want to include or exclude Del Ruth (Q93133323) or other surnames, you might want to filter just for FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?item wdt:P734 [] }. --- Jura 07:16, 3 November 2020 (UTC) I fixed a few that used \"Ruth\" instead of \"Del Ruth\" or \"van Ruth\". --- Jura 08:50, 3 November 2020 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: how will you tell from your query which person has surname Ruth and which has given name Ruth? --Infovarius (talk) 20:51, 4 November 2020 (UTC) Modify a query to cast the same globe Hello, I'd like to modify this query so that the given item (Q867556 in this example)'s globe should also be used to filter anything that is in a 10-km radius around the point of Q867556, in the same globe.

 Try it! – The preceding unsigned comment was added by Bouzinac (talk • contribs). \"geoGlobe\" should be \"globe\", but I'm not sure if that works well with wikibase:radius though. BTW We are trying to improve the situation for non-Earth coordinates currently mixed into P625, see Wikidata:Property_proposal/planetary_coordinates. --- Jura 08:57, 4 November 2020 (UTC) @Bouzinac: The geospatial search gives an error message if the globe parameter isn't a constant. So it will be necessary to first make one query to get the globe, and then make another query with the found globe inserted as a constant. If a bound variable was possible you could use this query: SELECT ?globe ?place
WHERE
{
  wd:Q867556 p:P625 ?locstatement .

 Try it! But it fails with java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Non-constant globe value is not supported yet.

I want:a) a query with all items that have given name (P735) -> a value that have writing system (P282) -> Greek alphabet (Q8216), but they don't have name in native language (P1559). For example, Nikolas Englezou (Q7036597) has given name (P735) -> Nikolas (Q97619413) which is an item that have writing system (P282) -> Greek alphabet (Q8216). Nikolas Englezou (Q7036597) has no name in native language (P1559) (in any language) so it must be in the results.b) a query with all items that have given name (P735) -> a value that have writing system (P282) -> Greek alphabet (Q8216), and they have name in native language (P1559) in a language different that Greek. (for example they may have only one value with P1559 in English, or they may have two values with P1559: one in English and one in Greek). For example, Nikitas Tsakiroglou (Q12881733) has given name (P735) -> Nikitas (Q39292409) which is an item that have writing system (P282) -> Greek alphabet (Q8216). Nikitas Tsakiroglou (Q12881733) has name in native language (P1559) in a language that is not Greek.

However it give more results, mostly Puerto Ricans because Puerto Rico (Q1183) has country (P17) but not located in the administrative territorial entity (P131). Why the 1776 filter? Didn't the inhabitants in the original 13 states become US citizens even if they were born before that date. And the other US states joined USA later anyway. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 02:44, 5 November 2020 (UTC) The filter was to avoid persons died before 1776. But actually, the threshold should be 1868 due to the en:Citizenship Clause. Steak (talk) 08:19, 5 November 2020 (UTC) That makes more sense. The use of date of birth (P569) should be then be changed to date of death (P570), and the variable name also changed. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 09:00, 5 November 2020 (UTC) Missing articles in English Hello,I'm wondering: what are the French-speaking Wikipedia articles with most interwikis... but not in English?

 Try it! It is faster to use an integer constant as object in the triple with wikibase:sitelinks as here, instead of using a variable and a filter. You can run the query repeatedly with decreasing constant values. The space between the number and the period is important here. Without the space, the number would be interpreted as a decimal number instead of an integer, and nothing would be found. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 07:42, 6 November 2020 (UTC) I found the next results after 60 at items with 50, 47, 45, 43, 37, 35, 34, 33 sitelinks. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 08:00, 6 November 2020 (UTC) Checking where entities are referredIs there a better way to answer the question \"Does this show up anywhere but as a statement qualifier?\" than the querySELECT ?sub ?uri WHERE {

  FILTER ( !regex(?uri, '/entity/statement/') )

}
 Try it! Can I test that ?sub is a statement without parsing the url? Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 11:27, 6 November 2020 (UTC) If I understand your request correctly, you want to have items with statements that have any qualifier with Hawaii (Q58425066) as the qualifier value. This is the query: SELECT ?item ?p ?qualifier WHERE {
  ?item ?p [ ?pq wd:Q58425066 ] .
  ?qualifier wikibase:qualifier ?pq .
}
 Try it! —MisterSynergy (talk) 12:22, 6 November 2020 (UTC) Sort of. My question began by wondering where any of the United States senate constituency (Q58425000) items were referred to. The result of the simple query seemed to be returning all statements qualifiers, but I was wondering if it was the object of any statements and so wanted to filter out results where the subject is a statement. Does this make sense? It looks like your query looks specifically for places where this entity is a qualifier. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 13:03, 6 November 2020 (UTC) I still don't really get it. Maybe for the moment have a look at DESCRIBE wd:Q58425066
 Try it! . This lists all triples where the item in question is involved as subject or object; some of them are rather technical, but it does contain all links from and to that item. In general, most backlinks to an item should have any of these prefixes: wdt: (main statement value, direct link from subject item), ps: (main statement value, via statement node), pq: (qualifier value, via statement node), or pr: (reference value, via reference node that is connected to the statement node via prov:wasDerivedFrom). Technically, there are a few other places (predicates) where items could theoretically be used as values, but it is very unlikely that you find any of those when dealing with election constituencies. —MisterSynergy (talk) 13:20, 6 November 2020 (UTC) This looks like it helps to answer my original question, though I'd like to do it for all instances of United States senate constituency (Q58425000). I guess my solution isn't awful, but I was more or less looking to check does ?sub have a specified prefix. FWIW, per my proposal on Wikidata:Project_chat I am planning to change the labels on such entries to add the word \"delegation\". I wanted to make sure I understood all uses of them before making such a change. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 13:29, 6 November 2020 (UTC) Okay now I see, I guess. The \"prefix check\" is indeed only possible as a string-based operation, which is rather inefficient. Optimally we'd have something like ?statement_node rdf:type wikibase:Statement (as described at mw:Wikibase/Indexing/RDF_Dump_Format#WDQS_data_differences, but not available here). However, given that this is a rather small data set, we can still do the string operation: SELECT * WHERE {
  ?s ?p [ wdt:P31 wd:Q58425000 ] .
  FILTER( SUBSTR(STR(?s), 1, STRLEN(STR(wds:))) != STR(wds:) ) .
}
 Try it! Seems like all constituency items are only values of electoral district (P768) qualifiers, and there is nothing else. —MisterSynergy (talk) 13:56, 6 November 2020 (UTC) Thanks very much. I had tried ?statement_node rdf:type wikibase:Statement but it didn't work. I wasn't sure if I misunderstood or if there was a better way to express it. I also didn't know you could run STR() on just the prefix. Very useful. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 14:49, 6 November 2020 (UTC) Filter fr description Hello I'd like to filter either french description or english description or NULL (having one row per item).

Q101104073 has no item description, which you have mde a mandatory requirement. --Tagishsimon (talk) 20:45, 6 November 2020 (UTC) I think, if I understand the question, this will find items where there is a French, English or Null (for all languages) description; it will emit the english if available, then the french.

DrThneed (talk) 01:35, 8 November 2020 (UTC) @DrThneed: More fu, above.

Right now, 1,311 such templates on en-wiki, afaics so NZ has first-mover advantage. Finally, to be very specific, we're getting people with NZ citizenship here.

  ?reftypeLabel Try it!I'm trying to build a good query that would show what references are used in an item that could potentially work and be displayed on any item.The above works somewhat for Franklin School (Q100000001) that has only 4 different references (+ some differences in formatting/reference url): the official website, myschool, some other website, the place name sign.If you change it to Q42, it's less condensed.Ideally the columns would probably be: the value of \"stated in\" (mainly label, possibly also the item) maybe also or alternatively, the label of the external-id property type of reference (if available) reference url (possibly external-id-urls included there as well) everything else available for the same reference could probably just be be concatenated in one column (not yet done in the above) + all claims using the reference (last column in the above) If there are some differences in the information for a similar reference, I don't mind if there are several lines (e.g. myschool in two lines for the sample above). The query doesn't fully join it to that point yet though.What do you think? --- Jura 06:24, 8 November 2020 (UTC) Facts from specific domain I am looking for all facts, containing certain relation, e.g. wdt:P361, bur restricted to a specific domain, let's say 'Artificial Intelligence'.

 Try it! This query goes a bit further - it finds all positions held by someone who's gone to space, and the \"astronaut\" query is extended a bit to pick up about ten or fifteen extra people who don't have occupation:astronaut set. I think there's over a dozen legislatures in there, but it seems tricky to limit it to only elected posts.

And then get a stats on the first letter (eg how much first B and how much first P). Thanks ! Bouzinac 💬●✒️●💛 09:42, 11 November 2020 (UTC) @Bouzinac: So this one is a little tricky because it's hard to pick out a \"Latin-alphabet language\" through SPARQL. If we do it by writing system (P282) on the Wikipedia, not all of them have it set; if we do it by writing system (P282) on the language, some like Azerbaijani (Q9292) have several different alphabets set. However, we don't really need it - because if the page title starts with a Latin character, we can assume it's in Latin script :-). So this query finds all the sitelinks, filters to just Wikipedias, and then checks if they start with \"B\" or \"P\": SELECT ?article ?letter ?name ?lang  WHERE
{
  ?article schema:about wd:Q16520 . ?article schema:name ?name . ?article schema:inLanguage ?lang . ?article schema:isPartOf ?x .

  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }

 Try it! This version tries to get script from the article about the wiki, if known, but there is a little overcounting because 2-3 wikis have multiple scripts listed. SELECT ?article ?letter ?name ?lang ?wikiLabel ?scriptLabel  WHERE
{
  ?article schema:about wd:Q16520 . ?article schema:name ?name . ?article schema:inLanguage ?lang . ?article schema:isPartOf ?x .

 Try it! This maps all the countries which have an official language that uses a \"B\", \"P\", \"Б\", or \"П\" form. Of course it's not a very reliable way of saying \"most common form used there\" - eg the US has no official language so it's blank, Canada has two where one uses \"P\" and one \"B\".

I'm doing this search for Swedish speaking Finns with a few bits of information and their Wikipedia page title in four languages. Why is the result empty after row 440 even though the result is over 2000 rows? Is it a Wikidata query error, or something else?Please help: https://w.wiki/m4f @Robertsilen: The problem here is that the OPTIONAL clause asks for a lot of different things, all within the same section, and so it will be blank if any of the pieces of information are missing. This means anyone with no death-date, or who doesn't have all four Wikipedia articles, will be blank and you'll only get the first two datapoints, person and label. The way to get around this is to make each of the bits independently optional, with something like: SELECT distinct ?person ?personLabel ?genderLabel ?occupationLabel ?birthdateLabel ?birthplaceLabel ?deathdateLabel ?deathplaceLabel ?sv_title ?fi_title ?en_title ?de_title 

WHERE {
  ?person wdt:P172 wd:Q726673.

Finding values for several independent variables in the same subquery will cause the results for all the independent variables to be joined already in the subquery which may in some cases give many results (like e.g. 100 times 100 times 100 for 3 variables with 100 values each), so I wouldn't do it. But the only way to find out what is fastest is to do some benchmark tests, which is difficult to do accurate due to caching and non-constant server load. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 09:31, 13 November 2020 (UTC) I see, thanks.

 Try it! --Esia1688 (talk) 11:24, 13 November 2020 (UTC) @Esia1688: I am surprised that you can run the query with subqueries at all. The subquery %exec5 will return all people on Wikidata, over 8 million. That is highly inefficient. In the other query without subqueries the triple ?item ?a ?ent . will run before before trying to find all people so the variable ?item will already have bound values and the search for people will only remove non matching values from the result. My point with using subqueries was to reduce the number of results in the first run parts of the query, not to increase it to millions. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 13:58, 13 November 2020 (UTC) @Dipsacus fullonum: Hi, I understand better now, thanks.

I'm pleased with the results, and I'll dig through it gradually as I'm learning, to see how principles apply. Super helpful. -Pete F (talk) 01:40, 7 November 2020 (UTC) @Peteforsyth: I have some comments about optimizing the original query: In the MWAPI call you use bd:serviceParam mwapi:gsrsearch \"insource:\\\"infobox newspaper\\\"\" . It would be better to use \"hastemplate\" (see en:Help:Searching#hastemplate:) instead of \"insource\" because the words \"infobox newspaper\" could be in the wikitext without transcluding the template, and because \"hastemplate\" also includes redirects to the template. ?pageid is extracted from the API call but not used and could be deleted. The LIMIT 15000 for the MWAPI makes no sense since there is a hard limit at 10000 results from MWAPI (there are about 8300 results so that limit isn't reached) Instead of       ?article schema:inLanguage \"en\" .
      FILTER (SUBSTR(str(?article), 1, 25) = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/\")
 use       ?article schema:isPartOf <https://en.wikipedia.org/> .
 (The predicate schema:isPartOf was introduced in 2016. I suppose the code is older than that.) The points above are also valid for the query for Washington state by Tagishsimon. Besides I have this comment about that query: I wouldn't turn the optimizer off for the whole query but instead use a named subquery to find all administrative units in the state first. But are you sure that it is a good idea at all? SELECT (COUNT(*) AS ?count) { ?place wdt:P131* wd:Q1223 . }
 gives a count of 20849 which is higher than the number of US newspapers. I would instead try to search the property chain forward with hint:Prior hint:gearing \"forward\". That way all US newspapers will be found first, then each is tested for placement in Washington. I suppose that is much faster. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 02:15, 7 November 2020 (UTC) @Dipsacus fullonum: Great, thank you. Makes sense, this will make a good learning exercise for me. I was wondering about that and meaning to dig into it a bit, thanks for confirming! OK, I can remove it. The original query was made by 99of9 (talk • contribs • logs) (maybe with input from others?) maybe they can speak to what that's here fore. It was written in 2018, but maybe drew on a chunk of earlier code? I'll try swapping that out. It will take me a little while to absorb what you're suggesting here, but I think you've provided enough info for me to mull it over. Thanks for this! (One thing that might contribute to duplicates is, IagoQnsi (talk • contribs • logs) recently created a lot of newspaper items, and there seem to be a number of duplicates -- I'm not sure if it's in the thousands, but I'm trying to get a sense of the scale of that as well, and see if there's a good way to programatically merge duplicates.) -Pete F (talk) 08:34, 7 November 2020 (UTC) @Peteforsyth, Tagishsimon: I have now tried my suggestions in practice. I first ran the unchanged query in 44 s. Then I implemented suggestion #1, #2, and #4, and it ran in 37 s. I am sure that #4 was the biggest contributor. For suggestion #3 I first tried to remove LIMIT 15000 but that was bad. So I instead decreased the limit to 10000 as MWAPI already has that as a hard limit. It seems that the optimizer can better schedule the query when it knows a limit on the number of results in the subquery. Then I replaced hint:Query hint:optimizer \"None\". with hint:Prior hint:gearing \"forward\". after the ?place triple. Now it ran in 22 s. Then I also used hint:Prior hint:gearing \"forward\". for finding subclasses of newspaper (Q11032) and removed the variable ?c. The final version ran in 21 s. Here it is: #defaultView:Map

 Try it! --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 10:22, 7 November 2020 (UTC) @Dipsacus fullonum, Tagishsimon, 99of9: This is great. I have played with this a bunch, and reviewed some instructions on building SPARQL queries. My next project, now that I know how to do it, is to customize this query to every state, and add a link to each relevant WikiProject page. I've also successfully made a variant to show all African American newspapers, though very few of those have been properly marked so far. I made a couple tiny improvements (I think): Removed the line requiring that it's a US-based paper (which is redundant in the cases above) Removed the line about USNPL IDs (I don't think this serves any purpose, maybe a vestige from the initial scrape and associated queries?) A few questions I'm still trying to figure out: The recent import increased the number of items from under 10,000 to more like 25,000. Much of the data is now bad (duplicates), and overall it's cumbersome to do US-wide searches (verrrrrry laggy). For a few states in the middle of the country, the import did substantially increase the number of good items though. If anybody has ideas about how to resolve duplicates at scale, I'd love to hear 'em. I'd like to figure out a way to have green override yellow and red, and yellow override red. That part of the code will require a bit more study. And/or, might be worthwhile to create separate maps for \"exists on English Wikipedia with/without an infobox\" and \"does not exist on English Wikipedia\". It seems impossible to generate a link directly to the map. The \"short link\" fails every time (I guess because it's such a long query). So, I copy the URL bar, but that goes to the SPARQL code instead of the rendered result. Maybe I can figure out the syntax to do this manually. It would be awesome to be able to directly embed the results instead of manually uploading to Commons. Maybe that feature is going to be developed? I'd like to figure out the hint:Prior hint:gearing \"forward\" bit. Anyway, here's the code I have so far (staying with Washington as example): #defaultView:Map

 Try it! @Peteforsyth: The US test may have a purpose. If it is faster for each item than the US state test, it can be used to reduce the number of results before testing for state and make the query faster. I left it in my code proposal for that reason, but I didn't make any measurements on it. It is very possible that it is best to remove it, especially since it uses two predicates. hint:Prior hint:gearing \"forward\" is placed after property paths like ?entity1 wdt:P31/wdt:P279* ?entity2. By default the query engine will assume that it best to find possible values for the object (?entity2) first and then follow the property path from right to left (reverse mode) to get possible values for the subject (?entity1). The hint ask the engine to instead search in forward mode from subject to object. You cannot link to the interactive map that can be made by query service GUI. But you can create interactive maps from the data at Wikipedias and other Mediawiki wikis by using the Kartographer extension. You will need to convert the data to GeoJSON format. It can be done by hand or by writing program in any programming language to convert the data. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 21:10, 15 November 2020 (UTC) Articles in idwiki but does not exist in enwiki Hello!

data = r.json()

# Iter results to check image urls
counter = 0
for person in data[\"results\"][\"bindings\"]:
    photo_url = person[\"photoUrl\"][\"value\"]
    person_item = person[\"person\"][\"value\"]
    rhead = requests.head(photo_url, allow_redirects=True)

    print(\"Revised %i images\" % counter, end=\"\\r\")
 Of the 2384 results returned by that query, only Angel Wicky (Q19056769) has its image deleted. In this case I only limit myself to the dataset of which I was interested in doing this check, but it is equally applicable to any Wikidata item with the image (P18) property. The script is something basic and probably with something like Scrapy (Q368367) can be improved and/or make it more efficient and I imagine that could also be used to make a maintenance bot or something like that.--190.231.242.204 03:24, 19 November 2020 (UTC) From this explanation, it seems you are looking for images still in use on Wikidata despite being deleted at Commons. Normally, when an image is deleted, I thought there was a bot that would eventually remove it from Wikidata (within hours). Also, wouldn't Krbot eventually check images for their existence when updating constraint reports? (I think this now runs ca. 10 days behind). --- Jura 04:00, 19 November 2020 (UTC) That explains why there were no more invalid images. The image that was linked in Angel Wicky was deleted on November 11th (see the corresponding deletion query).

First: the unit can be any length unit (m, km, mile, yard or other), so testing for one unit isn't sufficient. To make such cases easier there is also a normalized value which for length is the value in meter.

If you're looking to learn techniques to put less of a burden on that shared resource, great. But if you're going to make the same query often enough that speed matters, then you're probably better off pulling down the data and moving into some other store to which you make more frequent requests. I personally wish this perspective was more widely held and broadcast so that this shared resource remains useful to all, but that's just one man's opinion.

List of authors in the Portuguese Wikisource sorted by name and last name Basically, I want to replace pages such as pt:s:Autor:M with Listeria-updated lists. The first column is ordered alphabetically by first name and the second is ordered by last name. They link to the relevant Wikisource pages and have birth and death dates in parentheses. Can it be done? NMaia (talk) 03:55, 23 November 2020 (UTC) @NMaia: Probably not as well as it is done by hand. If we take a couple of examples of authors, Machado de Assis (Q311145) has two family names, so we could list him under d or m; and Manuel Botelho de Oliveira (Q10324024) has no family name, so we'd be reduced to guessing which of his names marks the start of the family name. Fernán Caballero (Q291397) has 3 given names but no indication of their series order. We have the mechanics to report on which items correspond to authors on pt.wikisource, but I suggest we lack the ability to produce rational alpha-ordered lists; even if that inability is only on the margins, those margins will be broad enough to annoy users. Here's what the data looks like. SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?givennameLabel ?series2 ?familynameLabel ?series ?article

Is it possible to produce lists for each letter? I want, as much as possible, a Listeria-updated drop-in replacement for that page. Also needed would be birth and death years (but not months or days). NMaia (talk) 05:14, 23 November 2020 (UTC) @NMaia: Again, yes, dob & dod are possible, as is filtering on the first letter of a chosen sort name. Presuming you have cleaned the data, it is easy. It becomes progressively more difficult to code if the deata is complex ... Antônio Rodrigues Ferreira (Q21450801) has two spellings of the same given name; someone else (I cannot find an example in the set before me) will have multiple dobs or dods. Briefly, I guess, we need to be able to establish one truthy given name, one truthy family name, one means of establishing the family names and given names which will be presented in the list and against which we will sort; one truthy dob & ditto dod, each to at least 1 year of accuracy. These are not trivial asks, even on this relatively small set of items. Here is a development of the query, but it fails because the current data has shortcomings (lack of useful BestRank, lack of series data, &c) and were I to write the query more defensively, we'd end up with complex SPARQL yielding few rows. When we can write a spec that says 'the definition of the given name is a concatenation of the truthy P735 value's pt labels optionally ordered by P1545, and the family name is truthy P734 value's pt labels optionally ordered by P1545, and take the truthy value for each of dob & dod', then we might be getting somewhere.

All the rest of the results are as the result of various report servers having different versions of senator items, which is very poor. (e.g. I've been cycling through, running the report, changing variable name, running the report again, changing a variable name ... there seem to be 3 or 4 different ideas on what the item values are, depending on which report server I hit. It's a bit crap. It's possible some of the items being flagged up may have the old-style district still in them, but clearly some do not & equally clearly it's the report servers that are in error) I remain *appalled* at your district=seat mismodelling.

There is a discussion about the modelling which you're welcome to continue participating in. As is mentioned there, it's most productive to center the discussion on the usefulness of the data with examples than on expressions of one's personal tastes. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 10:41, 25 November 2020 (UTC) @Gettinwikiwidit: It would be useful to be able to ascertain all seats elected by a district in a straightforward report, rather than having to consider that a district is a subclass of a district for the purpose of ascertaining the set of seats. Your model does not reflect the thing it is modelling and it does make reporting more complex and arcane than it needs to be. This is a question of your personal taste versus the ability to, for instance, select position where electoral district=texas, a basic ask which is no longer supported because the model is wrong. --Tagishsimon (talk) 10:54, 25 November 2020 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: It's just confusing to split this conversation across various pages.

 Try it! When we run this query now (2020-11) we get ca. 5K hits. In 2020-09 we ran \"the same query\" and got 13K hits. We have the Wikidata SPARQL-XML output from 2020-09 which indeed has 13K hits. It's a superset of our current 5K hits. But it doesn't record what query we submitted! Some of us are sure we submitted the same query. Others think that the query was a broader one. So one way to resolve it would have been to re-run it with 2020-09 version.The wider issue is whether it's possible to record the query in the SPARQL-XML.

The bot is aligning Wikidata with Disease Ontology (Q5282129) and Mondo Disease Ontology (Q27468140). Until recently, Disease Ontology (Q5282129) only used Xrefs to express mappings to external knowledge bases and identifier. However this turned out to be problematic, since the semantics of Xrefs are not wel defined. Not every XREF mapping is an exact match. Recently, Disease Ontology (Q5282129) started using skos:exactMatch to express exact similarity. Since XREFs mappings were no longer accurate we had to remove them from Wikidata and replace them with those that were expressed using skos:exactMatch. So indeed identifiers were removed (but only those with a reference to the Disease Ontology (Q5282129). Regarding the P31. Before WDQS existed there was WDQ which made traversing a tree rather complex. To be able to query for all disease items sourced from the Disease Ontology (Q5282129), we minted both a P31 and P279 at the time. However, semantically that was incorrect and not in line with how it is expressed in the source. There everything is connecting as subclasses. This task is long overdue, since the WDQS already exists for a while, but since we are updating identifier mappings we are also removing those redundant (and partly incorrect) P31 claims. So the number returning on the query above might even decrease more in the near future. The suggestion to use wdt:P31/wdt:P279* should return all diseases. --Andrawaag (talk) 13:27, 26 November 2020 (UTC) Sounds sensible. Maybe worth summarizing on Property_talk:P699. --- Jura 13:43, 26 November 2020 (UTC) The problem is that I didn't find the same identifiers added elsewhere. The nice thing about the field is that it doesn't really overlap with things that interest me. --- Jura 10:14, 26 November 2020 (UTC) @Petermr: You could try to find some items which were in your old results but not in the new results. Then look at the history for these items to confirm that they once had the statement instance of (P31) disease (Q12136) with best rank, but that they don't have the statement any longer or it is not best rank any longer. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 10:45, 26 November 2020 (UTC) Thanks, that's close to the answer, I think. Adding P279* gives ca 16K hits (16745 results in 10411 ms) SELECT ?item ?itemLabel 
WHERE 
{
  ?item wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q12136 .
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". } 
}
 Try it! So I think what may have happened is that some service (possibly in the Wikidata Query) expanded the query with P279*. And I suspect this query was submitted through the graphical query. We're still learning and this is clearly a caveat that we should always record the exact query in the box, or probably better submit it through REST. Anything that helps automate the capture of the query will be valuable.Note for Steak suggestion. We can't reverse engineer the query because any number of queries could give this answer Petermr (talk) 13:52, 26 November 2020 (UTC) As it's unclear to me what the output should be or is, maybe ?item wdt:P31*/wdt:P279* wd:Q12136 . is closer to what you are looking for (currently >31000)[1]. That it should or should not include Abortion in Arkansas (Q64876904) is another problem. --- Jura 14:00, 26 November 2020 (UTC) Trouble with ORDER BYThe following query doesn't seem to always obey the ORDER BY clause:SELECT * WHERE {
  {
    SELECT ?sen ?senLabel ?seatLabel ?seat ?termLabel ?stmt ?end ?replacedBy WHERE {
      ?sen p:P39 ?stmt.
      ?stmt ps:P39 wd:Q4416090;
        pq:P2937 ?term;
        pq:P768 ?seat;
        pq:P582 ?end.
      OPTIONAL { ?stmt pq:P1366 ?replacedBy. }
      SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }
    }
    ORDER BY (?seat) (?end)
  }
}
 Try it! When I last ran it there were disconnected Ohio Class 1 senate seat (Q101498888) sections. I'd expect all ?seats to occur consecutively and within a given ?seat them to be sorted by ?end. Is this not how it works? Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 09:17, 26 November 2020 (UTC) @Gettinwikiwidit: The ORDER BY applies to a particular SELECT statement. Above your ORDER BY matches the inner SELECT line, not the outer SELECT line. So your results get sorted into a nice order for the inner SELECT, but then returned in no particular order by the ultimate outer SELECT. You don't actually need the outer SELECT at all in the above, so just this: https://w.wiki/o4M is probably what you want. I've also changed the ordering from seat to seatLabel, which may be a bit friendlier for humans. Jheald (talk) 09:26, 26 November 2020 (UTC) @Jheald: Awesome! Thanks very much. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 09:28, 26 November 2020 (UTC) @Jheald: This is actually pretty interesting since the outer SELECT here is just a shell left around as an artifact of playing with the query. I guess it shows that SELECT isn't stable in returning bound variables from one context to another. Thanks again for spotting the issue. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 09:34, 26 November 2020 (UTC) Folding values in a queryHi there, this query almost does what I want it to.SELECT * WHERE {
  {
    SELECT ?sen ?senLabel ?replaces ?replacedBy ?start ?end WHERE {
      ?sen p:P39 ?stmt.
      ?stmt ps:P39 wd:Q4416090;
        pq:P2937 ?term.
      {
        ?stmt pq:P1365 ?replaces;
          pq:P580 ?start.
      }
      UNION
      {
        ?stmt pq:P1365 ?replacedBy;
          pq:P582 ?end.
      }
      SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }
    }
    ORDER BY (?sen) (?end)
  }
}
 Try it! What I'd really like is for rows of \"corresponding entries\" to be folded together. I.e. to have the replaces (P1365) match up with the replaced by (P1366) on a single row. I tried GROUP BY and MIN(?start) MIN(?end) but that doesn't work when there are multiple replaces (P1365) replaced by (P1366) pairs for a senator. (i.e. it's the overall min). If I could somehow combine the replaces (P1365) and replaced by (P1366) columns as well as the start time (P580) and end time (P582) columns into a new ?time column then if I use ORDER BY ?time the replaces (P1365) and replaced by (P1366) rows should be alternating which would be good enough. Any advice? It's probably usable as it is, but it would be easier if the \"corresponding entries\" were already aligned. Thanks, Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 00:11, 26 November 2020 (UTC) @Gettinwikiwidit: You're possibly looking for something like BIND(COALESCE(?start,?end) as ?date) --Tagishsimon (talk) 00:16, 26 November 2020 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: That sounds like what I'm looking for. I actually need to fix my query as well, but this will likely help. Thanks, Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 01:06, 26 November 2020 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: This works a treat. Thanks! FWIW, the idea is to produce the info in a typical info box. This lets us find the starts and ends of all the consecutive runs in a Senate seat. The same runs calculation will help make pages like this eventually. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 05:25, 26 November 2020 (UTC) @Gettinwikiwidit: The query you link doesn't really work. It uses replaces (P1365) twice and never replaced by (P1366). There are also other problems. But note that replaced by (P1366) is missing in many cases where senators have been replaced. This query is probably closer to what you want: SELECT ?sen ?senLabel ?replaces ?start ?end ?replacedBy WHERE {
  ?sen p:P39 ?stmt.
  ?stmt ps:P39 wd:Q4416090.
  {
    # Get start dates
    ?stmt pq:P580 ?start.
    OPTIONAL { ?stmt pq:P1365 ?replaces. }
    FILTER NOT EXISTS 
    {
      ?sen p:P39 ?stmt2.
      ?stmt2 ps:P39 wd:Q4416090.
      ?stmt2 pq:P582 ?start. # The senator also had another term immediately before this
    }
  }
  UNION
  {
    # Get end dates
    ?stmt pq:P582 ?end.
    OPTIONAL { ?stmt pq:P1366 ?replacedBy. }
    FILTER NOT EXISTS 
    {
      ?sen p:P39 ?stmt2.
      ?stmt2 ps:P39 wd:Q4416090.
      ?stmt2 pq:P580 ?end.  # The senator also had another term immediately after this
    }
  }
  BIND (COALESCE(?start, ?end) AS ?date)
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }
}
ORDER BY (?sen) (?date)
 Try it! --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 11:37, 26 November 2020 (UTC) @Dipsacus fullonum: Thanks. Yes, this is still a work in progress but it was enough to see that it was workable. FWIW, I'm looking to complete all of those missing replaced by (P1366) entries. You mention \"other problems\", but I don't understand why it wasn't enough to simply fix the reference to replaced by (P1366). I'm only interested in those entries which have replaces (P1365) and replaced by (P1366) so I'm also not sure why I need OPTIONAL clauses. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 12:08, 26 November 2020 (UTC) @Gettinwikiwidit: Well, then remove OPTIONAL. I added them because I thought you would want to see dates for start of first term and end of last term even then the predecessor or the successor isn't stated or isn't known yet or there wasn't any (for the first senators). --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 12:15, 26 November 2020 (UTC) @Dipsacus fullonum: Oh, I see what you're doing. Good point. This is curious, though. I don't believe this is someone establishing a seat. Perhaps because this query doesn't account for gaps in the seat being occupied? There are lots of edge cases and through my research I've noticed that many of them are realized. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 12:28, 26 November 2020 (UTC) @Gettinwikiwidit: Justin Smith Morrill (Q1045864)'s time as senator are stated twice in the statements, so it is also stated twice in the results. I wouldn't consider that a fault of the query. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 16:40, 26 November 2020 (UTC) Make a tree father country > child country (or the reverse) more visuable Hello, starting from this query, how to look the path from the very far away to the nowaday country ?

Thanks. --Infovarius (talk) 23:26, 26 November 2020 (UTC) Iconclass/project:sum of all paintings Regards from Vienna, actually I would be interested to participate on the project mentioned above. I tried to write a query to find out which objects have property P1257 ( iconclass) with value e.g. 71A1 ( beginning of old testament in bible). My knowlege of rdf and sparql is poor, so I did not succeed. Every time a mistake is displayed, and I do not understand how to solve the issue. The problem to handle should be how to insert a correct term for the object part of the semantic triple - is it an external identifier, a link to the site iconclass.org , a simple string (71A1), ,, or am I completely wrong? Any support is appreciated. Many thanks Christoph Lassmann (62 years old, interested in art history, native Viennese ;-) Hi Christoph Lassmann. This query will find all items with depicts Iconclass notation (P1257) with value 71A1, but there are none: SELECT ?item ?itemLabel
WHERE
{
  ?item wdt:P1257 \"71A1\" .
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],de,en\" . }
}
 Try it! --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 09:03, 27 November 2020 (UTC) As it's iconclass, you might want to check for strings that start with \"71A1\" (same result though): SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?value
{
  ?item wdt:P1257 ?value .
  FILTER( strstarts(?value, \"71A1\") ) 
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],de,en\" . }
}
 Try it! Another way could be to use depicts (P180) and display items that have Iconclass notation (P1256) on the value (not depicts Iconclass notation (P1257)).Nothing for \"71A1\" either, but for \"71A3\": Properties used: depicts (P180)   , Iconclass notation (P1256)   """@en;
