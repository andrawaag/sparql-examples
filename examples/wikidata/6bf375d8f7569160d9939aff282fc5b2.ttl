  rdfs:comment """ Request a query Fishing in the Wikidata river requires both an idea where to look for fish and a suitable fishing method. If you have the former, this page can help you find the latter. This is a page where SPARQL queries [Q114898838] can be requested. Please provide feedback if a query is written for you. You can also request help to rewrite queries that don't work anymore, due to the WDQS graph split. For sample queries, see Examples and Help:Dataset sizing. Property talk pages include also summary queries for these. For help writing your own queries, or other questions about queries, see Wikidata talk:SPARQL query service/queries and Wikidata:SPARQL query service/query optimization. Help resources about Wikidata Query Service (Q20950365) and SPARQL: Wikidata:SPARQL query service/Wikidata Query Help and Category:SPARQL.

I haven't figured out how to isolate the native label (P1705) for only the Skolt Sami (Q13271) values, so I'd appreciate the help. - Yupik (talk) 16:37, 1 September 2024 (UTC)[reply] @Yupik: select ?l ?lLabel ?sms ?p4119 {

Mahir256 (talk) 16:43, 1 September 2024 (UTC)[reply] Yes, thank you! - Yupik (talk) 16:45, 1 September 2024 (UTC)[reply] Help with WDGS [edit] Hi, I have a number of queries written as part of a project Wikidata:WikiProject LSEThesisProject and will need to re-write them due to the Graph Split. My SPARQL knowledge is basic and the queries produced were achieved by trial and error / modifying others' queries / kind help from the community. In preparation for trying to learn how I might re-write those queries I tried, using the Federation Guide, to write federated queries which would pick up all research outputs produced by an academic - this includes not only scholarly articles, but also book chapters, version edition translations, blog posts, chapters and articles. In the main graph as it was all these can be picked up in one query https://w.wiki/B6Ct but I'm failing to re-write this for the scholarly graph. I've tried """@en;
