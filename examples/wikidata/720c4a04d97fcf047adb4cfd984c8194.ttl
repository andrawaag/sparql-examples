So for this year, that would mean works published in 1925. But next year, 1926. I'd like to see a query that will not need to be tweaked every year and will always be current. NMaia (talk) 12:54, 1 January 2021 (UTC) I'm going to duck the larger question of the list of works based on publication date, for now, and just focus on \"not need to be tweaked every year\", which for the example query looks something like this: # Find works with a public domain date (P3893) in the calendar year in which the query is run

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 17:14, 1 January 2021 (UTC) Thank you! The issue is that public domain date (P3893) is not (yet) widespread, so publication date seems like it would catch nearly all cases. NMaia (talk) 04:41, 2 January 2021 (UTC) @NMaia: I don't have my copyright thinking hat on, but, is publication date the key, or is date of death of the author? I vaguely thought copyright in written works was life+nn years. If so, the query would find people who died in the pertinent year, and then list their works? Something like this. SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?person ?personLabel ?dod WITH {

 Try it! If instead we want to assess by publication date (P577) I regret to inform there are quite a lot of those, and we'd probably need to select subsets of the written work (Q47461344) class tree in order to get the query to run without timeout. We'd also need to be savvy about the difference between works and editions ... P31 values for written works (scholarly articles and some others aside) are a hotching great mess, which is why I'm not mad keen to dive in. --Tagishsimon (talk) 05:23, 2 January 2021 (UTC) find an artist by the signing date of an art work and the initials of the artist I have tried this: # find an artist by the signing date of an art work and the initials of the artist.

 Try it! It works for small sets of matches, but runs into timeout when e.g. changing from enameler (Q21148249) to visual artist (Q3391743) (which I really want). Any hints on how to improve the performance? --Herzi Pinki (talk) 16:23, 1 January 2021 (UTC) See Wikidata:Request_a_query/Archive/2020/11#publications_from_a_particular_year_and_place about the date queries. Instead of rdfs:label for the name, you might want to use the native label statement. commenting out '?firstname rdfs:label ?firstnameLabel' and the following (as ?firstnameLabel is predefined anyway), will be fast, but not return any result. I do not understand why this makes a difference, but it obviously does. --Herzi Pinki (talk) 20:18, 1 January 2021 (UTC) Possibly, year of death is more frequently available than date of birth. Some artists also have only work period specified. There is a tradeoff with artists still living. Who will not have a date of death. But date of birth should be optional too. --Herzi Pinki (talk) 20:18, 1 January 2021 (UTC) After \"?item wdt:P106/wdt:P279* wd:Q21148249\" you might want to add hint:Prior hint:gearing \"forward\". . --- Jura 17:39, 1 January 2021 (UTC) @Herzi Pinki: I would first filter for the least common initial in a new named subquery, and then for the other initial in another new named subquery, and then for the other conditions (years) in other subqueries. The goal would be to reduce the result set as fast as possible so you can avoid using time to process the last name and compare with the last name initial if first name doesn't match the first name initial, or inverse, and so on. But I doubt that timeout can be avoided even with the best possible optimization for visual artist (Q3391743) because there are too many (around 423900 distinct items) of these. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 18:52, 1 January 2021 (UTC) Your last statement says: Wikidata does not scale well? This will be an ever growing problem as more and more data get put into wikidata. I was thinking that '&& regex(?firstnameLabel, ?firstnamePattern, \"i\") && regex(?lastnameLabel, ?lastnamePattern, \"i\")' will only evaluate the second condition, if and only if the first one evaluates to true.

 Try it! (filtering names via patterns set in advance - the only diff is the 2 lines doing the filtering with regex near the end) and this again runs into timeout. As far as I understand, BIND is the sparql equivalent for setting a local variable. Seems to be a bug, that using the same regular pattern as a literal will finish in time, and using the same regular pattern set via a variable will fail.One more question / problem: running the query with D and K will yield also Theodor Kelter (Q2417843) (and others, all with Initials T & K), where the firstname is shown as Dr. Theodor (this explains the match). I have no idea where the title in the first name comes from and how to skip those matches.The hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true . does not seem to make much difference now. best --Herzi Pinki (talk) 12:24, 2 January 2021 (UTC) for the initial problem to identify DK on File:1160 Neulerchenfelder Straße 10 - Wandrelief Gründung der Gemeinde Neulerchenfeld IMG 3110.jpg I failed --Herzi Pinki (talk) 12:28, 2 January 2021 (UTC) SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?d1 ?d2 ?nl0 ?nl1 ?itemDescription

 Try it! @Herzi Pinki: I think once saw a bug report about the BIND problem.

That meant that it would find all descendants or ascendants for thousands people instead of only for 2 people.

I would just like to retrieve countries names, and I feel somehow the search is badly performed, it would be smarter to loop over continents, and then loop over countries, but my knowledge is too limited and since the query is already long I don't manage to make it work with trial/error method.

 Try it! Because some countries have parts in more than one continent, it isn't possible to know what continent a person is from if you only know their country of citizenship. It is not possible to query for the continent of mathematicians because the data isn't available. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 18:21, 2 January 2021 (UTC) Actually it's not a big deal if one item has more than one continent (and it turns out that some mathematicians have many countries and many continents), I have some kind of merge function that I apply afterwards, I would just like the query to go through. Well, I suppose that some would find it a problem to say that e.g. all Americans come from both North America and Oceania, but if it is no big deal for you then fine. I could run the query unchanged in 45 seconds. I suppose some optimizations can be done, but as the query has 83,099 results it will always take considerably time to run. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 23:10, 2 January 2021 (UTC) Mmmh I see your point. From what I observed, the 'main continent' is listed first. Is there a way to access specifically the first item of such a list or properties? Alternatively, I could manually modify property ranking for those that I spot, so that the query only retrieves the preferred property, for instance 'Europe' is preferable than 'North America' for 'Russian Empire'. Unfortunately I can't see the 'Edit button', is it because I'm not confirmed? I have only 10 registered edits, because I've done many of them anonymously. Could someone 'confirm me'? There is no defined order of statements in Wikidata, so none is \"listed first\". I wouldn't change rankings for this. Russia is both in Europe and Asia; USA is both in North America and Oceania (e.g. Hawaii) etc. What are the criteria for considering one part higher ranked than another? --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 11:38, 4 January 2021 (UTC) I have not understood everything in this system but it seems some properties are'preferred' to others. An example I stumbled upon recently is the 'notable works' of the Mathematician Henri Poincaré (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81082) His book 'science and hypothesis' is preferred to others and it is the only match to the query select ?notableWork  where {  wd:Q81082  wdt:P800  ?notableWork. }
 Try it! I don't really understood why but why not? But in this respect if North America is not a preferred continent for USA than Oceani then what is?? As a side question why can I modify notable works of 'Henri Poincaré' but not those of 'Russian Empire'? North America and Oceania are preferred rank for the USA item b/c those are the two continents where the USA has territory. Asia is normal rank b/c USA once had territory there, but no longer. The point of the preferred statements is to indicate, in effect, the truth of the situation NOW is that the USA has 2 continents; and of the normal rank 'that it once had this continent.' It would annoy Hawaii somewhat if North America alone were preferred since WD would suggest that the USA is not in Oceania. So Preferred tends to be used where there are a plurality of statements, some true now, some true once. Rank is very useful. Also very dangerous. In a set of notable works statements, to make one or some preferred, and others normal, begs the question of on what basis the selection is made. Douobtless the ranks will make sense presuming a set of assumptions, and will make no sense based on others. The way to deal with this in SPARQL is to use p:/ps: property paths if you want to see all values, and wdt: if you wish to see only truthy values. Meanwhile you can edit the notable works of 'Henri Poincaré' b/c that item has some. You cannot edit those of the 'Russian Empire' b/c there are none to edit. You can add some & then edit ... but does an Empire have notable works? --Tagishsimon (talk) 14:41, 4 January 2021 (UTC) Ok thanks for the explanation, I have indeed used p/ps for some other times when I wanted ALL properties, but here it is the opposite I am looking for 'the most relevant property'. I agree Hawaii could be upset that Oceania is not related to USA but it could understand North America is more relevant than Oceania if only one has to be chosen, and that could be useful for many ways one has to use WD. My point is that it seems that what is ranked higher or not is mainly subjective, as you can see with the notable works of Poincaré, they are all 'truly' works he has done (in the past), so why some are ranked higher? Is it somewhere in the guidelines of WD that a property is ranked higher if it is true now and lower if it was only true in the past? It obviously does not apply to all categories. I will not modify Russian Empire before I have totally understood this point, but why can't I modify continents of a country (neither Oceania nor Asia for USA) when I can modify notable works of Poincaré? Yes; on Poincare, generally agree it is invideous to prefer some of his works. I don't follow your point on 'why can't I modify continents of a country'. You almost certainly can add, remove, qualify, change rank. Explain some more? --Tagishsimon (talk) 15:22, 4 January 2021 (UTC) I just don't see any 'Edit' link anywhere in the page of the USA. Do you? Maybe some pages are considered more sensitive than others. Back to the main topic, basically if someone asks me what is the continent of USA I would answer 'North America' and I would probably not be the only one, I was wondering why this could not come up as a 'preferred statement', and what are in general the guidelines that determine how to choose how prefered statements are decided.

 Try it! @Tagishsimon: @Dipsacus fullonum: Thanks to you both! Trilotat (talk) 16:21, 7 January 2021 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: You can use wikibase:apiOutputItem like this: SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel 
WHERE {
  hint:Query hint:optimizer \"None\".
  SERVICE wikibase:mwapi {
    bd:serviceParam wikibase:api \"Search\";
                    wikibase:endpoint \"www.wikidata.org\";
                    mwapi:srsearch \"NWA haswbstatement:P31=Q13442814\".
    ?item wikibase:apiOutputItem mwapi:title.
  }

  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }
}
 Try it! Note that the object in the triple ?item wikibase:apiOutputItem mwapi:title specifies which data from the API call to use. mwapi:title fetches the title (Q number on Wikidata, article on Wikipedias etc.) which is what you want when you call Wikidata's API to get items. mwapi:item fetches the name of the connected item when you call API's of other wikis like Wikipedias and others, but you don't use mwapi:item on Wikidata itself. The predicate decides how to interpret the value. wikibase:apiOutputItem gives you an item URI, while wikibase:apiOutput gives a string. I hope that helps with your confusion. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 16:51, 7 January 2021 (UTC) Ah. Wikidata. Wikipedia. Different things. I think I'm up to speed again; thx. --Tagishsimon (talk) 17:13, 7 January 2021 (UTC) Items with existing it.wiki article but without wikidata Italian label Dear friends, I would like to have a list of wikidata items missing the Italian label albeit having it.wiki article connected. Bonus point, to filter only items of the previous list where it.wiki \"article name\" substantially differ from English wikidata label (e.g. Blanche of Anjou (Q3458673)). Luckyz (talk) 10:54, 8 January 2021 (UTC) @Luckyz: I don't think it's easily possible to provide you with the lists you want, because there are too many items to consider. The best you can do it hunt around in subsets of articles - call them haystacks - looking for your needles. As far as I know there are three approaches open in SPARQL: a regular query; a query based on interrogating IT wiki categories; and a query invoking the MWAPI search. Start with the latter; wikidata is indexed by a CirrusSearch, a MediaWiki extension that uses Elasticsearch to provide enhanced search features over the default MediaWiki search. Lovely. WikibaseCirrusSearch further extends it with some parameters useful for wikidata, but, not enough for us. We can launch a search looking for items that lack an IT label (\" -haslabel:it\") and constrain the search to items that have specific properties, such as IT citizenship (\"haswbstatement:P27=Q38\"), but iirc the search returns a max 10k items to be considered and only one of them meets the other of your conditions. Not least, it may well be that the search is returning items that have no IT sitelink & afaics we can't stop if from doing that, but only test for an IT sitelink once we have the results. SELECT ?item ?itemLabel_en ?sitelink ?itemLabel_it
WHERE 
{
  SERVICE wikibase:mwapi
  {
    bd:serviceParam wikibase:api \"Search\" .
    bd:serviceParam wikibase:endpoint \"www.wikidata.org\" .
    bd:serviceParam mwapi:srsearch \"haswbstatement:P27=Q38 -haslabel:it\" .
    ?item wikibase:apiOutputItem mwapi:title.
  }
  ?article schema:about ?item ;
           schema:name ?sitelink ;
           schema:isPartOf <https://it.wikipedia.org/> .
  OPTIONAL { ?item rdfs:label ?itemLabel_en . filter(lang(?itemLabel_en)=\"en\") }
  FILTER (str(?itemLabel_en) != str(?sitelink))
}
 Try it! Or we can do the same thing without search; a regular query which starts by selecting a subset of items - here, politicians with IT citizenship; and then run the various tests you specify - they have an IT sitelink, have no IT label, have a sitelink that differs from the EN label. But, again, thin pickings. You can choose different subsets to prime this query with; but anything too ambitious (the class tree of landforms, for instance (?item wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q271669 . ) will time out. SELECT ?item ?itemLabel_en ?sitelink ?itemLabel_it
WHERE 
{
  ?item wdt:P106 wd:Q82955 . 
  ?item wdt:P27 wd:Q38 .
  ?article schema:about ?item ;
           schema:name ?sitelink ;
           schema:isPartOf <https://it.wikipedia.org/> .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?item rdfs:label ?itemLabel_it . filter(lang(?itemLabel_it)=\"it\") }
  OPTIONAL { ?item rdfs:label ?itemLabel_en . filter(lang(?itemLabel_en)=\"en\") }
  FILTER (str(?itemLabel_en) != str(?sitelink))
}
 Try it! The final approach; look at IT wiki category membership. Tiresome and yielding mainly zero results. SELECT ?item ?itemLabel_en ?sitelink ?itemLabel_it

 Try it! So, they're my best shots. Sorry it didn't work out. @Dipsacus fullonum: may wish to comment on whether it is possible to recurse through a category tree in the last search; I imagine we might want to start higher in the tree - https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categoria:Politici_italiani - and look at members of all of the subcats. --Tagishsimon (talk) 09:26, 9 January 2021 (UTC) Hello, I've tried that way https://w.wiki/tjE : it looks to work but I'm surprised by the few number of results. Surely Dipsacus will help out ;) --Bouzinac 💬●✒️●💛 09:51, 9 January 2021 (UTC) I have a few quick comments now: I think Tagishsimon did a good explanation of the possibilities and I agree with it. But some optimizations are possible in the last query with the MWAPI call to itwiki. 1) There is no need to also check in SPARQL code if there is an article in itwiki (and I think that the check will cause a timeout if any article in the category happens not to be connected to Wikidata leaving ?item unbound.) 2) It may be faster to try to get the Italian label from the Wikipedia. You have access to Wikidata labels via the API parameter prop=pageterms. 3) You cannot make a deecategory search in it:Categoria:Politici italiani (too many subcategories) It may be possible to manually recurse the category tree (I have never tried) but you will run into the 10K limit, and I would not be surprised by a timeout. I may return to this when I have better time. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 14:38, 9 January 2021 (UTC) First of all, @Tagishsimon: thank you very much. I didn't realized that dimensions of database is, also in this case, the main problem. I managed to select specific occupation and I'm succeeding in extracting intersting results. So, thank you again! You're awesome. Luckyz (talk) 14:45, 9 January 2021 (UTC) Obviously, if it would be possible to have an increased dataset with more results, I would be able to better integrate labels. If @Dipsacus fullonum: will find time, I'm here to listen. thank you again. Luckyz (talk) 14:52, 9 January 2021 (UTC) Here is the last query without getting the ?sitelink variable. The was unnecessary because it already have the value in the variable ?name. I also inserted FILTER BOUND (?item): SELECT ?item ?itemLabel_en ?name ?itemLabel_it

'harward university'] I will loop this list, so that sending query to wikidata, searching for any matching result for the above three universities.So in short, the searching parameter will be the title of the university. And I'd like to matching the university title with the wikidata item label, and get all matched data returned with all available property and values. (ideally returned in json format) (So that I can do further filtering locally)I watched the wikidata official 1 hour and 51 minutes tutorial, which is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJph4q0Im98, but it's not solving my problem.Huge thanks to any help effort.Jay Young This, at least for the English label. An adaption of this can be made to look across all labels. I'm sure you can cause Python to talk to the API and get a JSON result, but that's above my paygrade. Note the match here is case specific; again, if case is an issue that can be tackled. SELECT ?item ?label  WHERE {

# Ingenue
UNION { ?character wdt:P31 wd:Q117482. }
# Fictional magician

Two things going on here: ?character wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q95074. is using a property path to get ?character that are an instance of, or a subclass of fictional character (Q95074). Then, because there are enough results, the query uses a named subquery to get the set of characters before seeking to get their DoB, DoD and labels. here's also a hint thrown in for good measure, explained on the same page as the named subquery. The query is on the verge of timing out - 55 seconds, fwiw. hth SELECT DISTINCT ?character ?characterLabel ?birth ?death WITH {

We query a subset of cities/locations (with certain parameters, I leave out the easy part) and would like to find out which of them is the nearest to the sea, or get the distance to the sea. After having used Wikidata and SPARQL to solve difficult riddles, why not using it to find a nice place to live? ;-)OK, joking apart: I found located in or next to body of water (P206), but this doesn't seem to be very widely used. And even with something like this we have only places at the sea, not places with the lowest distance to the sea. What other approaches come to your mind? I don't need the perfect query, just some ideas if and how it would be possible. Thanks! please ping me --Elya (talk) 18:08, 13 January 2021 (UTC) @Elya: Excellent query. Sadly, emblematic of the sort of thing that Wikidata can only do in the most patchy fashion, if at all. It could be tackled at the data level such as - as you point out - adoption of located in or next to body of water (P206), or (not a good idea) P31 values such as 'coastal town'. It could better be solved at the WDQS service level by a service that allows queries to interact in a meaningful fashion with shapefiles, for we have those, and they define coastlines in terms of a series of coordinates. The issue was touched on once before, as far as I remember, for the question 'can we say whether this coordinate is inside or outside the boundary defined in a shapefile, or, which of a set of shapefiles is this coordinate within'. And as far as I know, we have nothing very near this - I think we have bounding rectangles, but my country is not rectilinear. As to approaches; here's a lashup looking at which villages in Scotland are nearest to a port or harbour, using the geof:distance function. Interested (for a change) in Dipsacus fullonum's take on the best way to combine what are two distinct sets - the ?items and the ?places in this query.

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) List of data for stars with distance from Earth of less than 30 LY or parallax > 100 milli arc seconds. I am trying to validate a dataset for a new open source 3d astrographics program.For our first data set, I am looking for a list of all stars closer than 30 LY. Working with Simbad, I come up with approx 220 objects.I know that I want P31 Q523 -- Stars... but despite reading a LOT of the documentation, I have two problems: I can't for the life of me figure out how to filter on the properties Parallax (P2214) or Distance to Earth (P2583). It can't be that hard, and I'm certain I will hang my head in shame if someone points me at a how-to, but right now I'm stumped. i don't want hundreds of thousands of lines of data, I'm looking for under 250. I also can't figure out how to list the properties of the object, or blank if it doesn't exist. I'm wanting to list Mass, Constellation, Distance to Earth, Parallax, Proper motion, Radial velocity, Spectral Type, Luminosity, Metallicity, RA, Dec, Effective Temperature, and Simbad ID. Many of the objects will not have all of those, and I don't know how to get the blanks. Basically, all the tutorials and the various manuals I can find, along with the various on-line query builders, appear to either be very simple, or they assume I already know how the various parts of the query interact.I apologize for writing a \"newby\" request, but that's what I need.--Rboatright (talk) 04:40, 15 January 2021 (UTC) @Rboatright: Not sure exactly where you need help. Let's start with this; the query finds 10000 stars in a subquery, and then looks at whether they have a parallax and distance value. Because I'm not sure what sorts of values are accepted for distance, I've used the normalised value, and shown its unit - happens to be in metres (!). So I convert that into light years, and then apply filters for ly < 30 OR parallax > 100. (A lot of this is just me working out where we are heading - we can start throwing away columns later). You can fetch more values as per the parallax line - essentially, wrap things in OPTIONAL{} if you want blanks, do not wrap in optional if the value must be present. Come back with more questions? (Oh, and reason for the 10000 stars subquery - I fear we may have more stars than can be accommodated in a single query that uses filters ... you can push the LIMIT value up much higher if you want some more results, and use OFFSET n LIMIT m to page through sets of stars.)

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 05:05, 15 January 2021 (UTC) Here's a slightly more developed query. There are at least a couple of traps for the unwary: 1) because some stars have multiple values for some of their properties, we will get one row per the Cartesian product of all of the values; so in the query below I group and sample one of the rows; and 2) I've once again found the normalised value for mass, on the offchance that users can specify mass using a range of units. I have not checked whether the other values need normalising so there's a risk that we might have a muddle of units for some values. You may have a better handle on this than me. I've left a commented out version of the simple ?item wdt:P2067 ?mass_. condition, and then shown the same thing finding the normalised value (and within that clause, again commented out, the means of checking the unit.) The query would have to be amended for each condition where you want normalised values, and we'd have to work out what the unit for each is. Too laborious for me right now. If you do want to change the patterns so you;re looking for normalised values, in each optional clause, use a different ?statn value, so ?stat1, ?stat2 &c.

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 07:11, 15 January 2021 (UTC) Wow, that's an amazing piece of work. Thank you very much. Now, what is it that the Sample command does? And, I see how you use bind to tie the LY_ to the distance, and then the filter works on it, fine. But, which part lets the filter use the ?parallax_ value? I guess I just don't really understand. I'm used to using relational databases where I can include the limit on parallax directly instead of having to do the subquery near the top, and then filtering that. How would I get the NEXT 10,000 stars? I would think that there has to be a qway to query parallax directly, or perhaps there's some function that will let us get the second 10,000. The wikidata has way more stars than that. In any event, i learned a lot, thank you very much --2600:1700:CE91:6010:AD7C:637E:2781:A67A 10:54, 15 January 2021 (UTC) (Rick Boatright -- oh hell, I forgot to log in. ) @Rboatright: Where you have more than one row per item in the (ungrouped) results, and you group the results, the SAMPLE() selects one of the rows. Because the multiple rows are the Cartesian product of the values for a star, in effect we get a random selection of the values across all of the rows for that star. We could as well ask for MAX() or MIN(), or we could GROUP_CONCAT() the values. These are all your aggregate functions for SPARQL. The filter is two conditions linked by an OR statement - the double pipe (which can also be written as an exclamation mark between pairs of curly brackets on this page to prevent the SPARQL template from breaking). So it says list results where ?ly<30 OR ?parallax >100. I don't do much SQL, but the subquery is a means of getting a particular set, before the terminal query does stuff to that set. Were we not to do that, but instead try to get all of the values for all of the records and filter them all for the ?LY and ?parallax requirement, we would run out of our allotted 60 seconds. It's quicker to grab a subset that matches a basic requirement and process that. There are 3,296,389 ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q523 and pretty much trying to do anything with the whole set times out; if I move the acquisition of the ?LY and ?parallax, and the filter, into the top query and drop the limit to, say 200 (so asking for a pre-qualified small set of results) WDQS times out. As it is, we grab 100000 results and do stuff with them, which the engine can cope with. As to how to get the next chunk, for the most recent query, use OFFSET 100000 LIMIT 100000 where the current query has LIMIT 100000. And then so on. Tweak the LIMIT up or down depending on how many seconds each run takes; 60s is your limit and WDQS reports on how may hits and how many seconds were taken in the top right of the results pane. If it times out, make the LIMIT value smaller. I doubt my query is the last word in efficiency, it's just something that basically works. A further embellishment, below, (and the above query is timing out for me right now probably b/c there is more load on the report servers right now) is to grab a set of say 500k stars in subquery %i and then do the ?LY and ?parallax test in another subquery %j, and then subject the results of that set to the terminal query which does the expensive stuff - getting values and getting labels. See also Wikidata:SPARQL query service/query optimization for some more background, on Named Subqueries as well as more general optimization. If, btw, we know what the units for normalised values are (and here I was just discovering them) we could remove all of the processing relating to units, which would presumably greatly speed up the beastie. I'll point you at two more things, fwiw. 1) The data model diagram which sets out how data is structured in WDQS, and SPARQL Property paths. When, for instance, we ask for ?item p:P2067/psn:P2067 we're traversing a particular path through the data model; getting the p: statement node for a Property and then the psn: statement node for that first node ... we're traversing the three middle row bubbles in the model. I think that's analgous to a join in SQL, each predicate (p:, psn:) being something like a table. But I could be talking out of my hat. Anyway. The model. Property paths. They're key to a good understanding of WDQS & SPARQL. SELECT ?item ?itemLabel

And then so on.\" I am sorry to say it but that wont work. The results from a SPARQL query comes in an undefined order unless the query has an ORDER BY clause. You have no guarantee that queries with different values of OFFSET use the same ordering, so it is necessary to explicitly order by something. It doesn't matter what as long as it gives a unique ordering, so e.g. the item name (Q number) can be used. The normalized values are normally the SI unit (metre, kilogram etc.), but it may be advantageous to first examine if the used properties really do use more than one unit. Some properties like P2215 (P2215) has a allowed units constraint (Q21514353) constraint with a single value. Last but not least you can use the hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true hint for quantity values used in filters. For distance from Earth (P2583) don't convert the normalized value (metres) to light years before filtering. That is a wasted effort for items removed by the filter and prevents using the rangeSafe hint.

 Try it! --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 19:28, 15 January 2021 (UTC) What units do normalised values use @Dipsacus fullonum: Thx; above all noted. I've not hitherto had much truck with hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true . While we're here: is there a quick way of asking properties to divuge their normalised value unit, other than by finding an instance of a property statement value and querying its unit as was done in the above queries? So if I have the following properties & merely want to know, is it a property that creates a normalisedvalue, and if so, what is its unit: P2067 P2215 P2216 P215 P2060 P2227 P6257 P6258 P6879 --Tagishsimon (talk) 19:59, 15 January 2021 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: Normalized units aren't defined for properties, but for units. The system uses this table for the conversion. There are regular database reports which tell which units are used by each property. For parallax (P2214) see Wikidata:Database reports/Constraint violations/P2214#Units statistics (only one unit is used so no need for normalization), for distance from Earth (P2583) see Wikidata:Database reports/Constraint violations/P2583#Units statistics (several unit are used so normalization is needed) etc. The only way of finding normalized values for properties is to find examples, but that is fairly easy with a query like this: SELECT DISTINCT ?property ?propertyLabel ?unit ?unitLabel ?normalized ?normalizedLabel
WHERE
{
  VALUES ?property { wd:P2067 wd:P2215 wd:P2216 wd:P215 wd:P2060 wd:P2227 wd:P6257 wd:P6258 wd:P6879 }

 Try it! For the rangeSafe hint to work you have make sure you use the right datatype. In this example: ?item wdt:P2214 ?parallax.
hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true .
FILTER (?parallax > 100.0)
 it is important to use 100.0 (which is a literal of type xsd:decimal) because the values of ?parallax have the datatype xsd:decimal and you tell the engine not to check the datatypes. It wouldn't work with 100 (because that is literal of type xsd:integer) or with 1e2 (because that is literal of type xsd:float xsd:double). --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 20:47, 15 January 2021 (UTC) t/y * 2 --Tagishsimon (talk) 21:09, 15 January 2021 (UTC) Get wikis statistics from a query I have the following query that shows the multi-language versions of the different Wikimedia projects: SELECT ?wiki ?wikiLabel WITH {

 Try it! To those results I would like to add the following statistics: Registered users Active users Articles As I was seeing this data can be obtained through the Siteinfo API but it is not clear to me if it can be used with MWAPI. Does anyone know how this can be done from the query or is it not possible in this way?--Swicher (talk) 12:56, 18 January 2021 (UTC) @Swicher: When using the MWAPI service, you have to select one of the four supported services (\"Generator\", \"Categories\", \"Search\" and \"EntitySearch\"). None of them can be used to the fetch the site statistics, but nothing prevents you from adding a siteinfo request in addition to the selected service. But there is the practical problem that doing over 800 API calls in one query will cause a timeout, so in the query below I query only the Wiktionaries. A few of them don't give results. I believe that is because they are closed and don't have any pages. Here is the query: SELECT ?wiki ?wikiLabel ?endpoint ?articles ?users ?activeusers WITH {
  # Wikimedia content project subclasses (Wikipedia, Wikisorces, Wiktionary, etc language edition)

 Try it! Thanks. Ayack (talk) 09:43, 21 January 2021 (UTC) @Ayack: You probably want != rather than =!. The query then times out for me, but you can probably get it to work by stepping though ?child1 a block at a time. But please please be very cautious before adding 'missing' sibling (P3373) statements. With some of the recent big genealogical imports there are a fair number of items that have bad father (P22) or mother (P25) statements -- this can happen, eg after an incorrect merge has left someone with two different sets of parents. So at the very least please sanity-check any statements you are adding (eg are the parents known uniquely, are their dates compatible with the children, etc), or ideally don't do it. There are also a large number of unmerged duplicates from the genealogical imports. One way to go looking for these is to find multiple children of the same father with e.g. the same first-name and same date of death, that haven't been marked as sibling (P3373) of each other. There are still a lot of these to go through, see eg queries at Property_talk:P4638#Some_queries. Swamping everything with sibling (P3373) statements means sibling (P3373) can no longer be used to distinguish false positives (it will no longer be possible to distinguish pairs that have been marked in that way). And it means far more statements have to be found and undone if there is an error. So please, unless for some reason you really need these statements, please think twice before mass-adding them.
