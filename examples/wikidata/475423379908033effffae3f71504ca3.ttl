Realism' pls. Poul G (talk) 20:59, 9 November 2014 (UTC) We have no deadline. We try to get it out on Saturday. But given that it is basically just John Lewis and me we don't always manage to get it out on Saturday. The only way to improve that is to help us get the information together in time. Anyone can do that :) --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 11:16, 10 November 2014 (UTC) Help plan a new software feature for easy subscription to newsletters We are developing a MediaWiki extension that will enable users to subscribe to community newsletters much more easily. We are very excited to hear your feedback on the features we have planned. Feel free to share your thoughts here. - Tinaj1234 (talk) 12:38, 9 June 2015 (UTC) Translation ? Hi, I put the french translation on the \"/fr\" subpage Wikidata:Status updates/2015 10 24/fr. Don't know how to do this best. ATM the Wikidata WikiProject subscribes to the status update and I translate it there in french. I see that the Visual Editor Newsletter is translated : https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-ambassadors/2015-October/001277.html Maybe we could do something like that here ... author TomT0m / talk page 10:59, 27 October 2015 (UTC) I am fine with having it translated if someone is going to put in the work for marking it up and everything. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 13:31, 30 November 2015 (UTC) Specify a column width Hi, I'd like to suggest adding a minimum column width to the newsletter, so that it displays nicely in any window size, especially if there are images included. This would prevent problems such as mw:File:Flowbug.png in flow pages and http://i.imgur.com/UpwpJz3.png in wikitext pages.The code is -webkit-column-width: 400px; -moz-column-width: 400px; column-width: 400px; (change the numbers as desired) - see a demonstration at this sandbox diff, and I boldly tweaked the archive to show where the code goes.HTH. Quiddity (WMF) (talk) 21:57, 27 November 2015 (UTC) Thank you! --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 13:32, 30 November 2015 (UTC) Blog updates I am a subscriber to the talkpage delivery of the status update, but at least as my own personal preference, I was wondering if this could be published as a blog? I subscribe to the Wikimedia blog planet and would find these updates much more convenient to read via a blog format than on my talkpage. This is effectively what the Content Translation team does with - https://cxupdate.wordpress.com/ I realise that is yet another step in the workflow, but perhaps I'm not the only one who would prefer it delivered that way. Would that be possible please? Wittylama (talk) 11:01, 2 February 2016 (UTC) I wanted to automatically set up publishing of what we have to Planet Wikimedia but failed. It has been done for tech news previously without the need to have a separate blog. It just took what is on-wiki. If someone can help make this happen that'd be awesome. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 11:16, 2 February 2016 (UTC) New date? The previous statusupdates were given out on Saturday. Is Monday the new day to release the newsletter? Q.Zanden questions? 23:04, 20 February 2017 (UTC) Long time ago it was on Fridays :) --Papuass (talk) 08:41, 21 February 2017 (UTC) Yeah, as I always publish it on Mondays now, I just changed the date so that's the real date :) Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 11:47, 22 February 2017 (UTC) Templates Please, do not use templates (e.g. {{Channel}}) inside report. This report is distributed to many various wikis and some templates may not exist and some might be different . JAn Dudík (talk) 16:41, 3 April 2017 (UTC) You're right, thanks for the reminder. Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 10:43, 4 April 2017 (UTC) h1 sections Seems like something went wrong with this week's status update.Instead of sections of the newsletter having this format, where sections are lists of elements: * '''Discussions'''
** Open request for adminship: [[d:Wikidata:Requests_for_permissions/Administrator#Zolo_2|Zolo]]
** New request for comments: [[d:Wikidata:Request for comment/Proposed client side disambiguation page|Proposed client side disambiguation page]] they have this other format, where sections are h1 elements inside an h2 section (the whole newsletter): = Discussions =
* Open request for adminship: [[d:Wikidata:Requests_for_permissions/Administrator#Zolo_2|Zolo]]
* New request for comments: [[d:Wikidata:Request for comment/Proposed client side disambiguation page|Proposed client side disambiguation page]] This causes formatting errors and should be fixed/reverted. Sabbut (talk) 11:09, 18 April 2017 (UTC)+1, this effectively breaks the TOCs at every talk page… --MGChecker (talk) 14:46, 18 April 2017 (UTC) Yes, I made a mistake, I apologize for this. Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 14:55, 18 April 2017 (UTC) Unsuccessful RFPs @Pasleim: Was it necessary to add the unsuccessful RFA to this newsletter? It seems awfully embarrassing to have the candidate's failure spread across Wikimedia. --Rschen7754 05:34, 3 February 2015 (UTC) Adding a link to an open discussion in one newsletter but then not adding the outcome of this discussion in a later newsletter is in my opinion withholding of information. Also other users added unsuccessful RFA to the newsletter [1]. --Pasleim (talk) 13:09, 3 February 2015 (UTC) It's not withholding information, it's being sensitive to those who have failed a permissions request - and just because others are doing it doesn't mean that it's the right thing to do. --Rschen7754 05:11, 4 February 2015 (UTC) Newest properties auto-updating fixed [2] broke the auto-updating because Legobot could not figure out where to add in the new properties. I've changed it to use hidden comment markers instead, so as long as no one touches those, it should continue to work. 2601:646:8301:E297:158F:7316:3901:28DF 18:20, 21 September 2015 (UTC) WikiProject Association football/Euro 2016 We should add to the next weekly summary that we need help here. --Jobu0101 (talk) 00:03, 13 June 2016 (UTC) You can always just add things yourself. No need to ask here :) I'll add this one now. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 13:19, 13 June 2016 (UTC) Thanks. --Jobu0101 (talk) 14:42, 13 June 2016 (UTC) vCard I've restored the note about mapping the vCard ontology. I don't believe that we've ever documented such a mapping in this newsletter, and this is a good case study to encourage others to i) map other ontologies and ii) improve this mapping. @Lydia Pintscher (WMDE): Are you OK with this? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 18:24, 26 September 2016 (UTC) Given that this week is a bit thin anyway yeah. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 21:06, 26 September 2016 (UTC) Papers When a new paper is added, I think it would be worth creating an item for it as well. Maybe we should even link the item instead of the URL instead. I don't think we have included Q27038095 + a few others yet. --- Jura 10:26, 29 September 2016 (UTC)This is harmful; the purpose of this newsletter is to inform Wikidata volunteers and to encourage others to contribute; not to provide liked data to bots. Per the edit summary, @Lydia Pintscher (WMDE):. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 16:25, 1 October 2016 (UTC) Hey :) I agree that it is quite confusing for people not intimately familiar with Wikidata. Our interface etc are just not good enough there yet. If you really want to include it how about adding something like \"(also covered at Q1234)\"? --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 11:06, 2 October 2016 (UTC) I wonder if anybody not familiar with Wikidata is reading the weekly update. At least for these, it should be sufficiently \"user friendly\". The problem with providing urls is that they are not stable. Besides, the item provides additional information. Obviously, we could link the discussion of the papers in the forum instead. --- Jura 11:10, 2 October 2016 (UTC) As said earlier, I suggest we let the URL because it's the quickest way to access the content. But editors can definitely create items for the papers and add the Qid besides the URL. If you see a paper or another information that could be useful in the newsletter, don't hesitate to add it, it's a collaborative work :) Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 08:18, 3 October 2016 (UTC) Not sure what to say to people who see Wikidata items as \"not user friendly\" and \"harmful\". Makes one wonder if we are really on the same page. --- Jura 08:24, 3 October 2016 (UTC) My concern is that people who want to access the content can do it in only one click. If there is only the item, one will need to click on it, then find the link to the complete content, then click again to access. We know that if the process is not immediate, we loose attention from the readers. Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 08:42, 3 October 2016 (UTC) The problem is that these papers are frequently hosted at various places and it might not even be clear which one we should actually link to. I think it's an occasion to showcase Wikidata's capability as a database for references. Obviously, you might want to do that on an internal WMDE wiki instead. --- Jura 08:53, 3 October 2016 (UTC) Wikidata items are user friendly for people who want to see the data Wikidata stores. In this case, people will want to see the content of the articles, not their metadata. To extend your metaphor, is you who is on the wrong page. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 12:38, 3 October 2016 (UTC) Monthly Tasks I've boldly shuffled around, and partially rewritten, the Monthly Tasks section. I was primarily trying to get the developer-focused task away from the top, and thus make the list a bit more enticing for the diversity of readers. I also added a direct link to the Wikidata:Contribute/Suggested and open tasks page, which could always use more attention. HTH. :-) Quiddity (talk) 20:14, 20 February 2017 (UTC) Thanks :) Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 10:12, 21 February 2017 (UTC) @Lea Lacroix (WMDE): Hi, the latest \"clean for the next one\" edit, reverted all the tweaks to the \"Monthly tasks\" section. Just a note, so that you can copy the newer version, to wherever you store the empty skeleton. :-) Quiddity (talk) 17:44, 6 March 2017 (UTC) @Quiddity: Indeed! Thanks for the notice :) Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 09:17, 7 March 2017 (UTC) Headings The copy of the last newsletter left at my en.Wikipedia talk page had the wrong level of headings (fixed here. Please can we avoid a recurrence? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 07:42, 19 April 2017 (UTC) My bad, I'm sorry for this inconvenience. Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 09:02, 19 April 2017 (UTC) Becoming Wikidatian research paper This paper is now complete: Wikidatians are Born: Paths to Full Participation in a Collaborative Structured Knowledge Base. It may be worth including in a weekly status update. Runner1928 (talk) 16:39, 22 May 2017 (UTC) Thanks, I added it! Next time, feel free to add it directly, the weekly summary is open for contributions :) Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 09:19, 23 May 2017 (UTC) Dev Why there are mentioned (thanked) only some Dev contributor(s) in the corresponding paragraph? There should be mentioned either all of them or none. --XXN, 13:54, 17 July 2017 (UTC) Hello, usually we don't mention namely the employees who work in the development team. However, when a volunteer creates a new feature or fixes a bug, we mention his name to show support and appreciation. Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 22:11, 21 July 2017 (UTC) Christmas Are we still planning on publishing an edition next week, as Monday is Christmas Day? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 14:54, 20 December 2017 (UTC) Sorry I totally missed this. Published one day later. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 15:50, 12 January 2018 (UTC) Userscripts Do you have a policy about userscripts? A few times there have been userscripts in the newsletter, but not often. -- MichaelSchoenitzer (talk) 13:07, 1 January 2018 (UTC) No policy, no. If they are useful for other people and worth advertising then it is ok to add them. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 15:50, 12 January 2018 (UTC) Newest properties @Lea Lacroix (WMDE), Lydia Pintscher (WMDE): use at your discretion :) """@en;
