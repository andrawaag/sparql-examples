Could this project produce a how-to for adding more detailed information for names of people? For example: Let's say I have a person in Finland. Often the name in official documents is written in it's Swedish form. How should I mark that? A person is known generally by the second first name, nickname, or this varies across sources. How could I keep the variants in a good way? The last name is changed for various reasons. How are the reasons and dates attached? and many more. I am less interested in etymology than having a solid lookup reference for that specific person. Apologies that I am bluntly asking this before reading all the documentation, but I would like to access the best practices in a \"for dummies\" format. Cheers, Susanna Ånäs (Susannaanas) (talk) 13:44, 5 November 2016 (UTC) Maybe Q1124 can help you formulate one. --- Jura 13:54, 5 November 2016 (UTC) I am confused. Do you mean the Q-item or the person? ;-) I will need to learn what you have worked on, but I cannot possibly start creating the how-to myself yet. Susanna Ånäs (Susannaanas) (talk) 13:59, 5 November 2016 (UTC) Well, to be more precise: the properties and statements used on the item to describe the various names of subject of the item. ;) As this project frequently focuses on compiling (first) name items, you won't much information about it here. --- Jura 14:28, 5 November 2016 (UTC) What do you think of this: Anyone could write a (tricky) name or names of a person, explaining the whole history if needed. Others could help modeling by adding all the needed properties and qualifiers for that name/person. Finally that example could be placed under a proper heading, such as Uses of maiden name Uses of Spanish second family name Uses of a patronym/matronym Changes of names etc. The topics could be briefly explained, at least the intended use of the existing name properties and how they are currently tackling all the tricky issues.Cheers, Susanna Ånäs (Susannaanas) (talk) 14:44, 5 November 2016 (UTC) Sure. Our current system isn't necessarily that consistent (see the open questions on Wikidata:Bistro). As naming conventions change by language and country, it might be easier to focus on specific combinations. Properties with item-datatype are somewhat different from the ones with string/text-datatype. For your application, the later ones seem to be the more relevant ones. With the sample Q1124, you might be able to solve most of the questions. Ideally every person's item had \"name in native language\" and, if different, \"birth name\". --- Jura 15:13, 5 November 2016 (UTC) Yes I am being constantly a little confused by the name items versus names as text. I will face a similar modeling issue with historical place names for places. Is modeling names of people in general in the scope of this project? If, so, I could start a name clinic as a subpage, hoping that there will be people helping out! Do you think names for people and names for places should have a common project? --17:26, 5 November 2016 (UTC) For places, I think you already started WikiProject Historical Place. Not sure if yet another one would help. For places, the question is mostly on which item a historic name would go, for people, it's generally just one item. I suppose we could split between item- and text-properties, but this might not make it easier for users if they have to check language/country specific sections in each, so I'd attempt to add both here. --- Jura 10:20, 6 November 2016 (UTC) Icelandic people Please see Property_talk:P734#Include_Icelandic_.22last.22_name.3F. --- Jura 06:26, 17 January 2017 (UTC) Salih Ash Crow Dereckson Harmonia Amanda Hsarrazin Jura Чаховіч Уладзіслаў Joxemai Place Clichy Branthecan Azertus Jon Harald Søby PKM Pmt Sight Contamination MaksOttoVonStirlitz BeatrixBelibaste Moebeus Dcflyer Looniverse Aya Reyad Infovarius Tris T7 Klaas 'Z4us' van B.

However, @Aboulouei1: has changed the English and French labels several times to 'Salah Pacha', on the basis (if I understand the French correctly) that Salih is a mistranslation of the Arabic name. My understanding is that even if the name is \"incorrect\" like this, if it's actually in use in this form, it should stay as 'Salih', with a said to be the same as (P460) to other versions, such as Salah (Q19882606). Is this correct? --Oravrattas (talk) 21:58, 27 January 2017 (UTC) In Turkish we have both Salih and Salah, and I never thought they were the same name.

Let's take for example José (Q2190619). \"José\" is used in spanish and in portuguese, but it's is pronounced differently. So if you use latin script, which is the most common, it's all good. But if you use hebrew/arab/bengali/russian/chinese then it's a very big problem. Because in hebrew, the spanish pronouncation is \"חוזה\" (Hoze) and in portuguese it's \"ז'וז'ה\" (joje). Any solutions?--Mikey641 (talk) 14:42, 26 March 2017 (UTC) Duplicate given names according pronunciation looks acceptable to me: a generic José, given name, then specialized José, Spanish given name ; José, Portugese given name ; José, French given name, etc. --Dereckson (talk) 18:20, 26 March 2017 (UTC) Let's take in account that even Spanish pronunciation is different in particular regions. Just another case that shows how bad the idea of name related properties as data-type item is :( --Shlomo (talk) 06:55, 27 March 2017 (UTC) For now, we handle these cases like all transliterations: all possibilities are listed as aliases in a language. See Alexey (Q29014670); the name is in Cyrillic, the English aliases are all possible transliterations. I would add IPA transcription (P898) as qualifiers for language of work or name (P407) actually, before starting to separate items. --Harmonia Amanda (talk) 07:35, 27 March 2017 (UTC) @Harmonia Amanda: but it's very different, in all the english aliases in alexey, the pronouncation is the same, however, if we take the name jose, the pronouncation is different in each language. alexey won't need to be seperated, because it's the same in each language, but jose will have to be seperated to spanish and portoguese.--Mikey641 (talk) 19:22, 27 March 2017 (UTC) @Mikey641:, sorry, I wasn't clear, I didn't think it was the same problem, I thought it was a similar one: the same original-string name has several value associated (in one case, several transliterations; in the other, several pronunciations). As I said, I would suggest one item \"Jose\" (with one native label (P1705) with a \"multilingual\" code) which would have several values for language of work or name (P407) with, for each value the qualifier IPA transcription (P898). So that we know that \"Jose\" is written similarly in Portuguese and in Spanish and isn't pronounced the same. --Harmonia Amanda (talk) 13:22, 28 March 2017 (UTC) Actually, I think that this is the same problem. Having the name Alexey (Q29014670) for some person, how do you know if it is Alexey or Alexei or Aleksey or some other variant? --Infovarius (talk) 14:45, 29 March 2017 (UTC) I don't think it's exacltely the same because all the alexy aliases are pronounced the same but in jose it isn't. It is a different problm though--Mikey641 (talk) 16:32, 29 March 2017 (UTC) This is actually a frequent question. I think Santoz and Santosh, both spelled \"Santos\" are similar. We have three items for these. Yuriko is similar, but the other way round. --- Jura 05:45, 30 March 2017 (UTC) Male given name Ash Crow Dereckson Harmonia Amanda Hsarrazin Jura Чаховіч Уладзіслаў Joxemai Place Clichy Branthecan Azertus Jon Harald Søby PKM Pmt Sight Contamination MaksOttoVonStirlitz BeatrixBelibaste Moebeus Dcflyer Looniverse Aya Reyad Infovarius Tris T7 Klaas 'Z4us' van B. V Deborahjay Bruno Biondi ZI Jony Laddo Da Dapper Don Data Gamer Luca favorido The Sir of Data Analytics Skim E4024 JhowieNitnek Envlh Susanna Giaccai Epìdosis Aluxosm Dnshitobu Ruky Wunpini Balû ★TrekkerNotified participants of WikiProject NamesHarmonia Amanda, I'm opening it in a new section as it is not about pronouncing as above. I think that the solution of adding the name in the description field is wrong. look on this example József (Q17498051) the Hebrew name added is יוסף but it is not the possibility it might be also ז'וזף. In Hebrew (and not only in Hebrew) evry latin name might habe few suitable translations to Hebrew. This is no solution, but I do have solution for all cases. We have to open a given name ticket for every name per alphabet and should not allow adding translations to other languages.For example Shlomo (Q29017247) it's שלמה in Hebrew. It mat translated as Shlomo (Q21069189) --> Shlomo in latin alphabet or Solomon (Q18607853) ---> Solomon in latin alphabet or Shelomoh (Q29017272) --> Shelomoh again in latin alphabet and may more that can be seen in \"said to be the same as\" of Shlomo (Q29017247). Adding שלמה in Hebrew shouldn't be allowed and no need for that because Solomon (Q18607853) in Hebrew might be שלמה or סולומון. Adding שלמה label to the latin name is wrong. In that way evry person might have given name in Hebrew alphbet and also in English alphabet. And it might be different to every person. When I open the the property \"given name\" in Salomon Buber (Q982067) and I write שלמה which in his given name in Hebrew I should get only one posibility that says שלמה with the descriptin שם פרטי גברי and if I write salomon (his name in latin alphabet) I shoud get only one option with the description \"male given name\"In that matter. Don't know if it's possible. To avoid any option to add the Hebrew label we should close that option. Items with latin given name should have only labels in latin languages. Items with Hebrew alphabet should have only in Hebrew language. If it's possible technically of course it will be the best.Geagea (talk) 07:05, 29 March 2017 (UTC) @Geagea: I'm not exactly sure what you mean but I cleaned up your examples so we would better understand how the situation is handled right now (it's misleading to have items with incorrect descriptions as examples). When the language of the description doesn't use the same script as the name, the original name should be part of the description, so that we can differentiate. So Shlomo (Q29017247) should have \"male given name (שלמה)\" as English description, and Shlomo (Q21069189) \"שם פרטי גברי (Shlomo)\" as Hebrew description. So that when we are searching for a name, we can differentiate between all items who share the same transliterations based on the description. --Harmonia Amanda (talk) 07:21, 29 March 2017 (UTC) And the correct name in the original language as alias in all languages with a different script, of course. --Harmonia Amanda (talk) 07:23, 29 March 2017 (UTC) And all transliterations of a name in a language should be listed as aliases for that language. So for József (Q17498051), if יוסף is the chosen label (more frequent transliteration?) then ז'וזף should be an alias. But yes @Geagea:, we should never have two items with the same label and description with no means to differentiate between and the great thing is that it's technically not possible on Wikidata. So we just have to complete missing descriptions and aliases. --Harmonia Amanda (talk) 07:33, 29 March 2017 (UTC) I'm ok with you addings. My concern is about the list I get when I'm adding the name שלמה not about just search. When I'm adding שלמה to male given name in Hebrew I expect to see only one option with the description \"שם פרטי גברי\". If you add now henrew label שלמה to Shlomo (Q21069189) (which is missleading as it might be also שלומו) I will see two tickets. And if you add שלמה to all the list of \"said to be the same as\" I'll get a list 8 tickets with the name שלמה and the description \"שם פרטי גברי\". In my opinion adding label in hebrew to names in latin alphabet should be avoided by software. Geagea (talk) 07:52, 29 March 2017 (UTC) Uh, no @Geagea: you would not see 8 items with שלמה / שם פרטי גברי, you would see one of those and seven שם פרטי גברי (Schlomo) / שלמה ,שם פרטי גברי (Salomon) /שלמהם פרטי גברי (Shlomo) / שלמה, etc. If the items are clean, the descriptions allow you to differentiate. --Harmonia Amanda (talk) 07:57, 3 April 2017 (UTC) Harmonia Amanda, thank you for getting to the point. And which one of them I should choose? Won't it be easier to choose שלמה (Q29017247) in hebrew alphabet to a person from Israel without dealing with the latin name? I'm suggesting simple way to solve it. If we will add to a jewish person his name in hebrew alphabet, that will be necessarily correct. We can also add his name in cyrillic alphabet (different item of name with cyrillic alphabet) and in latin alphabet different item of name with latin alphabet). all of them are correct. First it is the correct way to add a name. שלמה is a hebrew name from origin, why latin alphabet should have the priority. Anyway, I think that non of the alphabet should have priority and all of them should be respected. See another problem with that kind of solution. The transcription from English to hebrew might be correct. as well maybe you can add correct transcription from english to Russian. But Is it nesasserily that the Hebrew transcription to Russian is correct? What about Greek Japanise and etc. Second, we should think how to make things simple. It is very simple to say people to add a name based on his origin alphabet and if there is not exist such then to create. the data base can be created faster if it will be simple for people and more of them can add private name.Geagea (talk) 10:33, 3 April 2017 (UTC) Most person don't have multiple given names. If a person is Japanese, their given name is in Japanese. The romanized version of the same name which exists as an American given name isn't a correct value for P735. Yes, there are cases where a person would have the \"same\" name in different alphabets: when the person changed countries for example. A Japanese person who became later an American citizen will have both their native given name and their Americanized one with start time (P580). But transliterations of the real given name are not expected values for given name (P735). We keep transliterations as label/aliases because when the French Wikipedia has an article about a Japanese person, the name will be in the romanized form. Someone who search the Japanese given name needs to find it while writing the romanized version (and need to have clear descriptions to know which one of the proposed items is the correct one). If a Russian person has as given name Alexey (Q29014670) (Алексей), then it's the only expected value and not the dozens of possible transliterations which also exist as their own right (Alexei (Q19820298) (Alexei) can be a transliteration of Алексей but it's also a German given name). People named Алексей are not people named Alexei, even if the first ones can sometimes have their names written Alexei when transliterated. --Harmonia Amanda (talk) 10:51, 3 April 2017 (UTC) Saying most person don't have multiple given names is not a solution. Moas (maybe all) Jewish people (-Israeli born) have given name in Hebrew together with other name. See Yosef Haim Brenner (Q939732). He have given name in hebrew Yosef (Q29051199). He have one name in cyrillic - Йосеф. Regarding to latin alphabet (or romanized to latin as you have mentioned) we have few options Yosef, Josef, Yossef and Joseph. He born in Ukraine so he have given name in Ukrainian, Russian (was part of the Russian Empire) and a hebrew name. Won't it be better th have one Hebrew alphabet name, cyrillic alphabet name? It can have few romanized names as mentioned above and also have the Arabic name يوسف which can be in hebrew יוסף or יוסוף. Hebrew speaking users can add the hebrew name and users Russian speakers can add the cyrrilic name and users speaking Arabic can add the arabic name. all the diffrent names can be connected to each other in the section \"said to be the same as\". I believe I'm suggesting simple solutions which includes all possibilities. Geagea (talk) 11:58, 3 April 2017 (UTC) As I don't even understand what your solution is @Geagea:, I'll have to disagree. From what I understand, you want to make it impossible to find names when searching their transliterations, and I don't see any case when making correct items more difficult to find is a solution. We already have people using wrong items (cities, musical albums, etc.) as given names because they don't even think of searching after the five first proposed items, how is making practically impossible for a French Wikidatian to find a Russian given name going to help us? You are not even clear to what the confusion is; all your examples are based on incomplete items: the obvious solution is to complete them. --Harmonia Amanda (talk) 18:57, 3 April 2017 (UTC) #New_datatype:_monostring_item might have achieved what you are looking for. Eventually maybe new features for Wiktionary will solve it. --- Jura 05:45, 30 March 2017 (UTC) Merge birth name (P1477) into name in native language (P1559)? I have difficulties with properties birth name (P1477) and name in native language (P1559). Both are for persons only and of monolingual-text type. Do we actually need both? It feels strange that I am supposed to move (?) data from name in native language (P1559) to birth name (P1477) after a person has married, and add new data to name in native language (P1559) at the same time. Typically our data does not have to be treated like this and can stay in its property even if it “outdates”. An idea would be to merge birth name (P1477) (27k uses) into the more general name in native language (P1559) (228k uses) and use qualifiers such as object of statement has role (P3831) name at birth (Q2507958) to qualify birth names. Has this already been discussed somewhere? What does WikiProject Names think? I would be willing to officially propose a merge at Wikidata:Properties for deletion, if the idea has sufficient support here. —MisterSynergy (talk) 08:02, 14 June 2017 (UTC) Where did you get the idea from that you are meant to move any statements? --- Jura 17:51, 14 June 2017 (UTC) Huh, what else should I do?! A person has a name which is stored in name in native language (P1559). This name becomes the “birth name” after a name change (e.g. after a wedding), and is superseded by the new name (e.g. “married name”). What to do now with the old name, now “birth name”? It needs to be moved to birth name (P1477) (or duplicated, even worse). Or do I misunderstand P1477 completely? —MisterSynergy (talk) 17:59, 14 June 2017 (UTC) You just add a new statement with a start date (and preferred rank). --- Jura 18:04, 14 June 2017 (UTC) Sample: If an item has P1559=\"Michelle Robinson\", add a new statement with P1559=\"Michelle Obama\" could be added. --- Jura 18:16, 14 June 2017 (UTC) This is what I do right now. But what’s P1477 good for then? —MisterSynergy (talk) 18:27, 14 June 2017 (UTC) For \"Michelle LaVaughn Robinson\". --- Jura 18:38, 14 June 2017 (UTC) @MisterSynergy: birth name (P1477) is also good for people known under a name totally different from their birth name (pseudonyms, actors, fighters, etc., and also for people who officially changed their name, whatever the reason of the change (migration, trans, religious... (etc.) :) --Hsarrazin (talk) 09:07, 21 June 2017 (UTC) Reorganizing the project page Apparently some want to move parts of the content to subpages and/or remove it. Oddly undiscussed deletions are deemed consensual, while restores of such deletions are considered \"non consensual\". In any case, let's restore the version we had before and then check what should be moved.Are we ok with the \"to do list\" to be moved to Wikidata:WikiProject Names/to do? Obviously we could mark some as done. Not quite sure if it's worth translating, but apparently this had been done. --- Jura 10:31, 19 June 2017 (UTC) I'm ok with the list of properties to be moved to a separate tab (subpage). --- Jura 10:35, 19 June 2017 (UTC) The obvious aim of this reorganization was to have an actually usable page and not at mostly three years out of date, incredibly heavy, not readable in small devices one. No consensual point was deleted; some complicated cases were moved to specific help pages, with a link to the generic help page in the new page. That's from experience with new contributors (I animate regularly workshops): too specific information is spooky when they are already trying to understand generic use. The only content which was summarily deleted is links to non-functional tools (such as Autolist) and very old subpages which haven't been updated since 2014. All the rest was only moved, not deleted. The \"to do list\" has nothing to do on the home page; all its content was rewritten in Wikidata:WikiProject Names/Help, except for misleading entries (like saying that the label should be the same in all Roman languages, when it's wrong when the item is about a Russian name for example; that's true only for Latin-script names, it should be explained more deeply). We should create more specific help pages, explaining clearly all the complex cases for which we have reached a consensus. I'm really curious what consensual thing has actually been lost in the change. For example, you added that the priority of the project was given names. That may be your priority, but that's not mine and probably not the priority of the project as a whole. You added that we should separate Spanish and Portuguese names, when @Hsarrazin: and myself have always stated our strong oppose with this practice (we can still debate but right now it's certainly not consensual). So, except for things which were added to the old home page without consensus, what did we lose? I know what we gained: an easy-to-read helpful page with links to go further as wanted. --Harmonia Amanda (talk) 11:14, 19 June 2017 (UTC) It's not entirely clear which changes you proposed. I do think it's a good thing to have a concise summary on one page, but it's a bad idea to spread the explanation on too many pages. If you create separate subpages, you should link them as tabs. No, I don't think we should remove the samples from the explanation. I don't think it should be problem stating what is or had been the project focus. Last discussion about this is at Wikidata_talk:WikiProject_Names#Project_focus_for_2016. --- Jura 11:29, 19 June 2017 (UTC) Not all subpages are deemed to be tabs. For detailed explanation, it's better to have a link in the relevant page section(s). For the project focus, you link to a discussion where you ask for a project focus and get no answer on that (and someone asks for a stats table, which is not a project focus), and for 2016. We are in 2017. Last, you reverted the page to the June 1st, 21:42 CEST stating that it is the last consensual version. Please point to the discussion that defines a consensus about this version. -Ash Crow (talk) 11:49, 19 June 2017 (UTC) Edit: @Jura1:, sorry I forgot to ping you. -Ash Crow (talk) 12:01, 19 June 2017 (UTC) - And with the correct name, it will work better >_< -Ash Crow (talk) 12:02, 19 June 2017 (UTC) The project focus was stated that way for quite some time, but we haven't revised it (and none requested it). I fail to see the discussion about the consensusal changes .. Is this offline discussion you participated? The only discussion I was involved myself was on Hsarrazin's talk page. Maybe another ping you forgot or you inserted in a way that it can't work? --- Jura 17:50, 19 June 2017 (UTC) I propose a page with only three tabs (home, properties and reports/queries), a clear presentation of the project stating that it's complex and many complicated cases need to have their own help page, listing the few basic principles (only those which are without a doubt consensual, nothing controversial at all in this section), listing the most used tools and gadgets so people know how we operate and then listing the numerous specific subpages the project has (or should have; we should create more help pages). The end would be a page light enough to be readable, not too large so it can be viewed small devices such as phones(I would prefer only two tabs actually, but both properties and reports should be easily accessible, so…), with clear sections so everyone know where to find information. I would structure /Help as a list of specific help pages, and I maybe would create a page about all \"non consensual practices\" which some contributors want and some strongly oppose, which would link to all relevant discussions here. But the actual home page of the project would only list practices we all agree with, which is totally not the case in the old version. --Harmonia Amanda (talk) 12:14, 19 June 2017 (UTC) I think it's going in the right direction, but there is just a risk that you are splitting things up too much. Removing samples from the explanation isn't ideal either (I don't mind if you change or rotate them). Personally, I like the general structure of WikiProject Movies: A home page a page that explains how it's done (with properties and more). Currently you seem to split this between \"home\", \"properties\" and \"help\" for WikiProject Names. a page with tools and reports (to build things). Part of the procedural \"help\" on \"help\" for WikiProject Names might fit to this. some statistics (most of those on WikiProject Movies is automated). and page with actual reference lists generated through project. (called \"lists\" not \"reports\" as for WikiProject Names). It also has \"new\" tabs, but these aren't essential. Wikidata:WikiProject Czech Republic has a similar structure. Note the difference between maintenance queries and showcase queries. I don't think it matters whether these are lists or queries .. --- Jura 17:50, 19 June 2017 (UTC) What would be the advantages of combining reference lists with pure maintenance reports? --- Jura 09:57, 24 June 2017 (UTC) Tabs Ok, vote time: who want which version? [1] clean tabs with three links: home, properties, reports and queries [2] clean tabs with four tabs: home, maintenance reports, reference lists, queries [3], bad code, three tabs: home, maintenance reports, reference listsI didn't think that correcting bad code and updating the links would be controversial but if it is, then vote! --Harmonia Amanda (talk) 21:18, 19 June 2017 (UTC)Ash Crow Dereckson Harmonia Amanda Hsarrazin Jura Чаховіч Уладзіслаў Joxemai Place Clichy Branthecan Azertus Jon Harald Søby PKM Pmt Sight Contamination MaksOttoVonStirlitz BeatrixBelibaste Moebeus Dcflyer Looniverse Aya Reyad Infovarius Tris T7 Klaas 'Z4us' van B.

Flow has been successfully in use on the French village pump for six months now, without any downside.

With Flow, you can use ctrl + f on the page, and results appear external Google search too. What is correct is the results for the namespace Topic: aren't currently available to the internal MediaWiki search engine. --Dereckson (talk) 10:45, 20 June 2017 (UTC) Comment So practically, there is no way to search archived discussions? I can understand that some users who tend to ignore online discussions may want to achieve that, but I don't think this is desirable. --- Jura 09:55, 21 June 2017 (UTC) Personally, I noticed this when trying to search for past discussions on Wikidata:Bistro. It probably went mostly unnoticed so far as Flow is mostly used on userpages. It suggests that it's not fit for general use. --- Jura 09:41, 24 June 2017 (UTC) Support. Sure. --Dereckson (talk) 10:45, 20 June 2017 (UTC) Comment Another little problem: To hide/delete the title of topic is necessary an oversighter, an admin haven't the right to do it. (Phab:T163061) --ValterVB (talk) 11:35, 21 June 2017 (UTC) Comment Another issue is history of edits. It is not trivial (and not useful) at Flow. --Infovarius (talk) 12:39, 23 June 2017 (UTC) Comment There are a few advantages listed in the initial comment. Have any of these every been a concern on this page? If there is no advantage, why would we want to loose all past discussions? --- Jura 09:59, 24 June 2017 (UTC) Yes. As steted with the very first phrase of hte initial comment. -Ash Crow (talk) 13:17, 2 July 2017 (UTC) The only advantage I am aware of is that it is easy to \"thank\" for an edit in Flow. Otherwise Flow only makes it more complicated! I am not enrolled in this Wikiproject, I therefor do not vote, but you can count me out on participating in discussions if/when they are turned into Flow. -- Innocent bystander (talk) 13:37, 2 July 2017 (UTC) We are still in the phase of evaluating the need for it given the loss of the project's history on one side and a single edit conflict by Ash Crow on the other side. --- Jura 15:51, 2 July 2017 (UTC) the There would be no lost of the project's history.

There are: Santos (Q18352926) (no language specified). Santos (Q20813204) (Spanish) Santos (Q20813183) (Portuguese) Santos (Q20813195) (Brazilian Portuguese) One would use (1) unless it's known that one of the more specific ones applies. All are spelled \"Santos\", but pronunciation can be quite different.Personally, I don't think that this is a priority, but, if people want to use them, I don't see why not. I'd restore the corresponding summary in the page.It's not fundamentally different than items we always had for Jean (fr) and Jean (en). --- Jura 10:09, 24 June 2017 (UTC) I don't see any fundamental difference between those 4 items, which are all written in the same alphabet, other than the pronunciation... the origin of the name is the same, the writing is the same, the meaning is the same... the Name project will become absolutely impossible to manage if the only difference is phonetic... since in every language, and even in the same language, in different regions, the pronunciation of a word can be different... I cannot see any reason why those should not be merged it is very possible to complete a different IPA transcription (P898) for different pronunciation in different languages on the same item, corresponding to the same writing :/ --Hsarrazin (talk) 12:18, 25 June 2017 (UTC) How will interwiki links be managed for these items? How can we link related Wikipedia articles together in the structure that you suggest? Remember, hosting interwiki links is also the primary purpose of Wikidata, and this purpose is not served if we split quasi-equivalent concepts on 5 different Wikidata items. Place Clichy (talk) 08:28, 27 June 2017 (UTC) I am very angry. Don't be so Latino-centric! Just look at these labels: Сантос / Сантус / Сантуш/Сантос / Сантус / Сантуш/Сантос / Сантус / Сантуш and those: Константин/Константин/Константин/Константин and tell me, why the former should be merged but the latter shouldn't be merged? To argument I say magic words: \"spelling is different\" (from me: in any language). P.S. Look again at #Constantin / Konstantin / Constantine merger at Q7111053 --Infovarius (talk) 14:23, 27 June 2017 (UTC) Infovarius: I think it's good to re-visit questions once in a while, nothing to be angry about it. A potential maintenance issue Hsarrazin mentions could be solved for Santos and Jean if we use a different P31 value for 2./3./4. above. Do you agree? --- Jura 15:57, 2 July 2017 (UTC) User:Place Clichy if I understand your question correctly, the answer to your question is the use of said to be the same as (P460) :) sorry, Infovarius, I don't understand if you're angry with my proposition or Jura1's ... :) we are now trying to solve the non-latin name problem (Konstantin or other) by using name in native language (P1559) to distinguish if the writing is the \"original\" writing of the name, or a transcription in another alphabet... this way, we can recognize the names, whatever the original writing is, including cyrillic russian, ukrainian, belarus, or other... don't you agree with it ? --Hsarrazin (talk) 17:13, 2 July 2017 (UTC) @Hsarrazin: As far as I know, said to be the same as (P460) does not provide interwiki links between related items. (Maybe it should, but at the moment it does not.) Therefore, in my opinion items considered to be the same should be merged if it is the technical way to provide these interwiki links. The fact that the same first name is spelled Wladimir in German, Vladimir in English and Vladimír in Czech does not change the fact that it is the same name, and actually pronounced the same, and interwiki links between the corresponding Wikipedia articles are legitimate. Splitting these items results in removing legitimate and useful navigation links. My concern is for the casual reader, who actually reads Wikipedia, not Wikidata. I have made this point at Project:Names before. I also agree with arguments put forward by Infovarius on latin-centricity this issue. I am not in favour of merging all items of similar-looking or related names though (such as all versions of John/Ivan/Giovanni/Hans, that would be absurd) : in my opinion, a good place to stop is any time you find two concurrent articles in the same Wikipedia language (in some cases these Wikipedia articles can also benefit from being merged, but that is another issue). Place Clichy (talk) 09:23, 4 July 2017 (UTC) I think we answered your question before and provided a solution. Is there are Wikipedia where you contribute and need help implementing it? --- Jura 09:29, 4 July 2017 (UTC) it is possible to build a template that uses said to be the same as (P460) to bring interwiki links on a specific wiki. It has been done on some wikis... Need to search more to find where... --Hsarrazin (talk) 09:38, 4 July 2017 (UTC) Hsarrazin: Do you think the dedicated P31 values could solve it or are there other issues to take care? --- Jura 09:29, 4 July 2017 (UTC) no, Jura, this is absolutely contrary to the option that has been taken to use a specific item for each string... you can make it (because you know these specific languages) for Santos, but you (and I) would not be able to recognize thousands of cases where other people would think it would be better... it is an open door for nonsense and totally unmanageable project. Please, don't ! and this is a Strong oppose --Hsarrazin (talk) 09:38, 4 July 2017 (UTC) Can you give a sample? Is there are a problem with some of the items using Jean or Santos? --- Jura 09:41, 4 July 2017 (UTC) Royalties and family names  Gustaf V of Sweden (Q52890) has birth name (P1477):\"sv:Oscar Gustav Adolf Bernadotte\" and family name (P734):Bernadotte (Q21502260). I am not 100% sure, but I think that is wrong. That Swedish royalties have family names at all is unusual as long as they stay inside the royal house. Also Princess Madeleine, Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland (Q212035) has such claims and there I am pretty sure it's wrong. Prince Sigvard Bernadotte (Q447209) used this family name, but I doubt he was born with it. How do you handle persons without family names?Another problem comes with older names, from times when the orthography had not become stable yet. Gustav I of Sweden (Q52947) has Gustav (Q746076) as \"given name\". How do you select which spelling you should use? -- Innocent bystander (talk) 14:28, 28 June 2017 (UTC) Not all name properties may be suitable for every item about a person. It may be that family name can't be applied. If a person has none, you could use \"novalue\". For Charles XIV John of Sweden (Q52927), my personal opinion is that family name (P734):Bernadotte (Q21502260) would be correct. You probably more versed in the finer points of Swedish royals' names. As for Gustav I of Sweden (Q52947), you can use several values in given name (P735). Personally, I'd add the one with the spelling that was actually used by the person. --- Jura 06:51, 29 June 2017 (UTC) That is the problem, Swedish spelling wasn't invented yet in the 16th century. -- Innocent bystander (talk) 07:12, 29 June 2017 (UTC) We could try to transcribe the spelling on the image I added to the right of this section (File:Autograf, Gustaf I, Nordisk familjebok.png). --- Jura 07:21, 29 June 2017 (UTC) In this case it looks like \"ff\" in the end. But this was not the only spelling he used. As I told you, he couldn't spell. Nobody could, not even those who translated the bible. -- Innocent bystander (talk) 13:46, 2 July 2017 (UTC) What would you use? --- Jura 15:24, 2 July 2017 (UTC) Wikidata:WikiProject Names/Request properties for a specific item ? Once in a while, I come across a name that seems hard to de-compose into properties. I think it would be good if we had a subpage just for asking about such cases. Maybe there is a better subpage name. --- Jura 09:51, 4 July 2017 (UTC) Cleaning up the category tree Today I was looking at the subcategory tree for \"anthrponym\". It looks like there are many opportunites for merging here, but I think a basic hierarchy should be established first. Has anyone done any work on that, or does anyone know of an external ontology for names that we could use as a model? - PKM (talk) 23:18, 6 August 2017 (UTC) This projects mainly uses the ones listed on the project page: given name (Q202444), female given name (Q11879590), male given name (Q12308941), unisex given name (Q3409032), family name (Q101352), and name.

Maybe criterion used (P1013), has characteristic (P1552), instance of (P31). --- Jura 09:43, 14 December 2017 (UTC) Etc. = 8 (personal name system (Q16655449) for example)? --Fractaler (talk) 10:32, 14 December 2017 (UTC) Maybe more like the values in the second and third column at ru:Именная_формула. --- Jura 10:37, 14 December 2017 (UTC) We have 2 formats/formulas: full nominal formula/format, full name (second column) and short name, modern short formula/format (third column). --Fractaler (talk) 11:01, 14 December 2017 (UTC) The idea is to use the one value that describes best the string found in P1477/P1559/etc. All these values could be instances of Q16655449. So yes, maybe 8, 16, etc values, at least if they are different in one way or the other. I think @Matěj_Suchánek: tried to parse some of these to generate P735/P734.

For example, in the case of the Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso (Q17293), he has a birth name and a Dharma name (Q1543672). Both are technically given names (most Tibetans don't have family names), and each one contains two names (parts). The birth name is ལྷ་མོ་ (Lha-mo) + དོན་འགྲུབ་ (Don-'grub), and the dharma name is བསྟན་འཛིན་ (Bstan-'dzin) + རྒྱ་མཚོ་ (Rgya-mtsho) [actually the full dharma name is much longer, but it's often shortened to those two parts]. So should we put all 4 names into given name (P735)? Or maybe create a separate property for the dharma name? If we just use given name (P735), which qualifier should be used to distinguish the two names? Any thoughts? --Stevenliuyi (talk) 16:42, 23 December 2017 (UTC) I went ahead and added the names Q17293#P735. Please let me know if my approach is appropriate. --Stevenliuyi (talk) 21:35, 9 January 2018 (UTC) Duplicate Japanese name?

It’s noted as « instance of : first name ». I’d prefer at least noting this as « subclass of : first name » because an initial stands where many first name can stand. I guess that the creator @Jura1: did this to be able to use this in « first name » property without constraint violation, or in a batch mixed with actual name. Can’t we do better ? Like authorizing the constraint on « first name » to have a class of name as values ? Doing stuffs this way seem to me like shoehorsing to our model incorrectly to make the constraint system happy.

Hi,I am not sure if this has already been suggested somewhere: apologies if so.Now that we have lexemes, I wonder whether they would not be more appropriate than items to model name. Name items are basically determined by their native label (P1705) and their labels tend to be identical to that string: that seems to indicate that names do not really belong to the conceptual domain, but rather to the lexical one. Names can have variations by gender or case: that seems to match pretty well the structure of forms of a lexeme. Furthermore, people already create lexeme for names (such as Lydia (L362)) - surely we do not want to maintain the same database in two different namespaces?Lexeme support is still experimental and no mass import should be done, so in any case we should wait before migrating anything.Pinging Tpt who proposed something similar on IRC (I think). − Pintoch (talk) 14:41, 16 June 2018 (UTC) Comment We have lexemes, yes, but unfortunatly only for single languages. Lydia (L362) = Lydia as a German name.

What is the best way to handle this? Should I create a new item <fictional family name> and make this an instance of it? (There are also other rather famous fictional names, like \"Buddenbrook\", the family name of the title characters of Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks (Q326909)). Beyond the fact that there are articles about fictional names such items could be useful to describe the origins of the fictional names (inspiration etc.). If there are fictional names, how should they be linked to real names if there happen to be people actually having this family name (even though the author made it up)? Maybe via fictional or mythical analog of (P1074)? Any ideas? - Valentina.Anitnelav (talk) 10:58, 16 December 2018 (UTC) Seems to me that a name can't be fictional. It can be invented by some author, yes (but some \"real\" names for real persons were invented by some human too). It is used by fictional character, ok. But it (not its analogue) can be (potentially) used by a real person. Actually real names are creative works as much as names of characters. --Infovarius (talk) 23:19, 16 December 2018 (UTC) Not everything human-made is fictional but I agree that this is odd as for every fictional name there could exist a person that carries this name. But then: what to do with Cambremer (Q2387635)? Just make it an instance of family name (Q101352) even though it is not a page about a name in reality (concerning its distribution, variations, etc.)? Make it an instance of fictional family (Q15331236) even though it is rather about the name? - Valentina.Anitnelav (talk) 06:31, 17 December 2018 (UTC) I would use as simply family name (Q101352).

The names are identical, but I thought that if male given name (Q12308941) and female given name (Q11879590) exist, then there should be distinct items.I see a message about a constraint there: that they cannot both have the same value for family name identical to this given name (P1533).Is this a good constraint?Should there be just one item for both male and female names?Is this perhaps an FAQ that should be documented somewhere?Thanks! :) --Amir E.

Deryck Chan (talk) 13:59, 3 February 2020 (UTC) @Deryck Chan: For CJV, we create the \"compound\" given names always. It would be \"學友\". For Korean, it should be the same (like Jeong-hwan (Q16256121) \"정환\"), but Korean Wikipedians added some given names in two parts years ago. So now there are thousands of entries using \"연\" (1) \"준\" (2) instead of \"연준\". Most of these have Korean given name element (Q69680123) as an additional P31. Sometimes I try to create the missing compound given names and replace all the uses, but it's not that frequent. There are so many simply missing given names in these languages that \"cleaning up\" this Korean specificity doesn't seem worth it (but if you are motivated, I'll help, I'm just discouraged doing it alone ^^). --Harmonia Amanda (talk) 14:11, 3 February 2020 (UTC) @Harmonia Amanda: Understood.

This will (probably) unfold over the coming months.I hope this may be helpful.

I’ll keep that in mind. The DFD lists which language(s) a name belongs to – we’d have to compare this to the language of the monolinqual text in native label (P1705). By the way, our current plan is that we’ll work on matching DFD entries in late autumn / early winter as a concentrated project. I’ll give updates when the plans substantiate. Julian Jarosch (digicademy) (talk) 14:59, 24 June 2019 (UTC) @Julian Jarosch (digicademy): I don't think you need to do that.
