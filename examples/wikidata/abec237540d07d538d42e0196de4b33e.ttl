As instructed, I'm notifying the community of my request for Oversight access: Wikidata:Requests for permissions/Oversight/DannyS712. Thanks, --DannyS712 (talk) 03:19, 1 December 2020 (UTC) Merge Main article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180-degree_rule Shall be linked with it: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achsensprung_(Film) – The preceding unsigned comment was added by 188.96.224.152 (talk • contribs) at 13:56, 10 November 2020‎ (UTC). When do we use Start/End time qualifier and for which sources of information it is applicable? Hi CommunityHope you are doing well!I'm looking for your guidance regarding the start/end time qualifier that we have to include when an old website is switched to a new one, for example. However, I was wondering should we use this qualifier also for Name, Address, Phone number and etc? I would really appreciate it if you could explain more thoroughly when and where we should use Start/End time so I could follow strictly Wikidata's guidelines on this matter.Thank you in advance!--Valgetova (talk) 13:54, 30 November 2020 (UTC) It's applicable whenever information changes over time (was true at one point in time and not at another) and it's still the same item. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 14:00, 30 November 2020 (UTC) Thank you for your kind response User:ChristianKl My last question is if this start/end time qualifier is mandatory to be added for every edit that we make in Wikidata? For example, if I change business name am I obliged to add this qualifier or it depends on my desire to include this information? Thank you once again! --Valgetova (talk) 06:42, 1 December 2020 (UTC) It's against Wikidata's rules to delete valid data. If at some point in time a business was named X and has a official name (P1448) statement or a statement with another subproperty of name (P2561), that's name is not allowed to be removed. You can add a new name without adding qualifiers but then it's not clear to a user whether the old name still applies if you don't add qualifiers to the old name. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 12:19, 1 December 2020 (UTC) Translation of a title Hello everyone,Could someone translate the title of this page either in English (international language) or in Norwegian (language that is concerned). I can't do it by myself. I know there's only one article (from the Walloon Wikipedia), but I intend to translate this article in French and in Dutch.Sincerely yours,Èl-Gueuye-Noere Model de-transition I have created Keira Bell (Q103120340) but I dont know how to model a person who was born female, transitioned to male and then de-transitioned to female. My guess is that at least she should be recorded as female right now. Is there a consensus on how do this? Or should it even be recorded? Maybe significant event (P793) would be the right approach? I also could not find an example here on how to do this. --Hannes Röst (talk) 15:43, 1 December 2020 (UTC) I would use start time (P580)/end time (P582) to specify the time when the individual genders where true and mark the current gender as preferred value. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 16:02, 1 December 2020 (UTC) end cause (P1534) may also be of use. --SilentSpike (talk) 11:20, 2 December 2020 (UTC) Olympics At Oscar Kreuzer (Q461349) we have \"participant in=1912 Summer Olympics\" and \"participant in=tennis at the 1912 Summer Olympics – men's outdoor singles\". Looking at various Olympic entries we have a mix \"participant in=YYYY Olympics\" and \"participant in=YYYY event at the Olympics\" with some containing one or the other, and some with both. What do we want as our standard? I was assuming once we had event, the \"participant in=YYYY Olympics\" would be redundant. But I think a bot may be involved adding \"participant in=YYYY Olympics\" based on a category at Wikipedia. --RAN (talk) 21:05, 2 December 2020 (UTC) We have items for each and every event of the modern Olympics (example: tennis at the 1912 Summer Olympics – men's outdoor singles (Q2314432)) and they are all properly connected via has part(s) (P527)/part of (P361) with the Olympic discipline event (example: tennis at the 1912 Summer Olympics (Q855399)) and further via has part(s) (P527)/part of (P361) to the Olympic Games edition (example: 1912 Summer Olympics (Q8118)). I spent quite some time last winter to get this pretty complete when the Sports-Reference.com website as the most reliable source was about to be closed and it was unclear at that time whether there would be an appropriate successor. For participant in (P1344), the most specific item should be used, so please do \"participant in=tennis at the 1912 Summer Olympics – men's outdoor singles\"; it could be qualified with further related information, such as the final ranking in that event using ranking (P1352) and some other things. Mind that this is also pretty much the level of detail that one would add to an infobox in Wikipedia, which means that this data structure aims to be most useful for data use by Wikipedias. The \"participant in=1912 Summer Olympics\" claims have in most cases been added some years ago when event-level items were often missing, and they should probably be removed in order to avoid redundancy. —MisterSynergy (talk) 21:26, 2 December 2020 (UTC) Kip Noll (Q390033) El Gaafary has reinserted claims of birth date and death date, citing probably unreliable sources, like IMDB, and (possibly) using original research. The person's rumored death has been debated at Egyptian Arabian Wikipedia talk page and en:Talk:Kip Noll. At enwiki, the death rumor has been disregarded per core content policies like en:WP:NOR. Why couldn't the user apply the same principle to Wikidata and Egyptian Arabian Wikipedia? George Ho (talk) 09:13, 1 December 2020 (UTC) EnWiki has different policies then other Wikimedia projects. Given that the Libary of Congress believes those birth & death dates are real, I don't see a problem with them. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 12:35, 1 December 2020 (UTC) What about Wikidata:Living people? Are the standards just as high as enwiki? Furthermore, the LOC page cites Wikipedia, Wikidata, and IMDB as \"sources\". I don't see how it is reliable at this point. By the way, I don't know much about standards on pages about living persons at arzwiki. George Ho (talk) 18:47, 1 December 2020 (UTC) The living people policy exists for living people and he seems dead. Even would apply it it's a different principle then the one you pointed to as being used on EnWiki. The libary of congress is an authority that does research. It's not perfect but no source is perfect. Better sources might his SALT LAKE TRIBUNE obituary from the May 24, 2001 but that unfortunately doesn't seem to be easily available online. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 19:46, 1 December 2020 (UTC) I was able to access the obituary via ProQuest (just go to Wikipedia Library). The obituary does not refer any alias of the deceased person \"Thomas Earl Hagen\", and it doesn't mention \"Kip Noll\" (or similar names) as well. To me, it doesn't verify the connection between the two names. George Ho (talk) 01:54, 2 December 2020 (UTC) answers.com suggests \"It appears that Kip Noll was actually Thomas Earl Hagen, born in Greenwich, CT, on August 7, 1957. The location and date correspond to information given by Kip Noll in a STALLION magazine ((June 1982) interview.\" is that article also available via Wikipedia Library or another way? ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 12:43, 2 December 2020 (UTC) I don't know which specific policy prevents me from (re-)deleting unverifiable yet sourced birth and death dates and locations. Is it \"use common sense\" policy? However, that's not the only issue. As I have realized, Wikidata and other projects have become interdependent with each other, especially by sharing Wikidata into infoboxes. I notice other threads about. I fear that Wikidata's impact on projects would undermine the influence of English Wikipedia. Don't you think? BTW, enwiki doesn't take Answers.com seriously; it's user-generated, like Wikidata. I tried finding the Noll interview on Google and Wikipedia Library; no such luck except data about the magazine issue itself. George Ho (talk) 18:06, 2 December 2020 (UTC) @George Ho: In general sourced data should NEVER be deleted on wikidata; if you doubt its veracity you can adjust the ranking (if you have a reliable source for your doubts, then use \"deprecated\" rank and describe that with the reason for deprecation qualifier, otherwise add a new entry with \"preferred\" rank and the value you think is right, along with any source for that). Wikidata is designed to allow for multiple conflicting sources of information to be present on the same item. ArthurPSmith (talk) 18:21, 2 December 2020 (UTC) ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ I couldn't deprecate because customization is impossible. Instead, I must insert another item as \"reason for deprecation\". Say that I would like to insert either \"English Wikipedia\" or \"chicken\", but that's due to AutoCompletion feature. Also, connection Stallion interview and the obituary would be original research, which is against enwiki's policy (and other policies applied), isn't it? Somehow, I could not find Wikidata's policy about this.... unless Wikidata is allowing original research? Where's the RfC or past discussions on this? George Ho (talk) 18:51, 2 December 2020 (UTC) There's no Wikidata policy forbidden this. I'm not aware of any RfC that tried to implement such a policy. \"reason for deprecation\" indeed has to be an item. In particular it should be a subclass of Wikibase reason for deprecated rank (Q27949697). If none of the existing one's say what you need in a specific case you can create a new one. We do it that way, because Wikidata in multilingual and every language version can show the reason for deprecation this way by translating the label. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 19:20, 2 December 2020 (UTC) Isn't creating another item less practical than what people have been optimistic about? Anyways, perhaps I should create an RfC without creating a draft yet... but I'll make the discussion about original research on living people, not about original research in general, which can be separate from my narrow(ed) topic. Any other ideas besides it? George Ho (talk) 20:37, 2 December 2020 (UTC) The idea is that there are a finite number of reasonable reasons for deprecating statements and in most cases we can reuse existing statements. Creating a new item is for those rare cases where there's a new valid reason for deprecating that doesn't already have an item. Wikidata is structured data. Structured data makes some things harder but has advantages like translation into other languages and it being easier for computers to interact with it. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 23:20, 2 December 2020 (UTC) I created three more items: Q103598308, Q103598309, Q103598310. George Ho (talk) 00:14, 3 December 2020 (UTC) Regarding original research, I've been encouraged to publish original research on Wikiversity. I've accumulated a number of technical reports under \"Wikiversity:Category:Freedom and abundance\". There is now a w:Wikipedia:Wiki to journal publication procedure for submitting an article from Wikipedia to a refereed academic journal. I haven't studied that, but something similar could doubtless be done with a well written research report on Wikiversity. DavidMCEddy (talk) 20:07, 2 December 2020 (UTC) Wikidata:Property proposal/cites work string I made a proposal for a new property. Based on the feedback I have been adding \"placeholder for <somevalue>\" only to have it replaced by a bot. For me the whole understanding of the argument why the proposed property is controversial becomes lost again. My intention is not one of mix'n match, my intention is to have links to papers.Having worked on adding citations for this paper, I find that adding a new item with only one maybe more properties would suit me fine. I would add a DOI and all the rest is extra. The benefits are: 1 it makes no material difference for my workflow, 2 it generates an identifiable paper that will show up properly as a referenced paper in Scholia, 3 it will enable links for citations from other papers enabling its growth. However such a paper is of the one but lowest level of quality; it only has a presence and one link. This would be no problem when there are processes that clean up and import the missing information..Please comment. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 07:08, 1 December 2020 (UTC) The basic reason that it's opposed is that it solving the problem this way would mean creating a bunch of different XY string properties for different cases. Handling it with unknown value Help means that users can use that model with any property instead of us having to create new properties. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 13:45, 1 December 2020 (UTC) I understand. I hate it that a bot is replacing the placeholder with a text. I assume that you can query for \"scholarly papers\" with such a string. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 15:24, 1 December 2020 (UTC) If you have a problem with a particular type of bot edits it would make sense to link to a diff and ping the bot. Otherwise it's a lot harder to engage with your complaint. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 15:30, 1 December 2020 (UTC) an example.. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 15:59, 1 December 2020 (UTC) placeholder for \"somevalue\" (Q53569537) is a workaround for QuickStatements not supporting unknown_value being specified directly. The bot just changes it to the thing that's meant. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 16:05, 1 December 2020 (UTC) what tool / workflow are you using to import these papers? is it entirely manual? is there a reason a tool cannot be used? in a perfect world the tool would make the items for the missing articles. in principle though i'm not against the proposal but I'd prefer we invest in tooling. BrokenSegue (talk) 17:13, 1 December 2020 (UTC) What I do at this time is entirely manual not by choice but by lack of tools. I cannot trigger an update for a paper or for an author. I attended a presentation about this paper.. It introduced a methodology to consider ecological diversity. At this moment I am adding missing papers to Wikidata in order to complete the papers it used as a citation. There are no tools, the quality of what we have at Wikidata is poor as a consequence. So yes have tooling and have something that works for now. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 12:07, 3 December 2020 (UTC) Tight crops only? Will someone explain to me with reference to Joe Henry (Q1810016) why there is a need to crop the photo I took, which has been the image on this item since 17 February 2015? Was there some decision I missed that Wikidata wants tight crops only, or is someone being arbitrary? - Jmabel (talk) 05:16, 3 December 2020 (UTC) Why are you asking here? An IP added a tag to a photo on Commons. It's a commons issue. (Your image is ... not very good - very poorly lit. I'll change the Joe Henry (Q1810016) image to Joe-Henry DSC00919.jpg, which whilst being b&w, seems about the best of those in the Joe Henry category.) --Tagishsimon (talk) 05:27, 3 December 2020 (UTC) Q59318277 seems to have disappeared How can the history of Q59318277 be researched?I created a citation to it on 2018-12-04.I believe it was a valid QID when I created it, though I can't prove that. However, it seems to have been valid on 2020-07-26, because it was NOT listed on Wikiversity:Category:Pages with empty citations on that date, even though three other Wikiversity pages were listed there then. However, early this morning, 2020-12-01, I was notified that it appeared then on Wikiversity:Category:Pages with empty citations.I believe it used to describe A People's History of the American Revolution, which I just recreated this morning as Q102951790.This says to me that something strange happened between 2020-07-26 and 2020-12-01. I see only two possible explanations for this: Q59318277 was valid when I created it but disappeared from Wikidata sometime between 2020-07-26 and 2020-12-01. Q59318277 was invalid when I created it but was only detected as such and added to Wikiversity:Category:Pages with empty citations until after 2020-07-26, over 1.5 years later, even though it had been invalid since I created it 2018-12-04. ??? Thanks, DavidMCEddy (talk) 19:35, 1 December 2020 (UTC) On 24 April 2019 it was deleted by User:Jianhui67 following the request at Wikidata:Requests for deletions/Archive/2019/04/24#Q59318277. You can actually see the deletion log entry on Q59318277 and find the deletion request via Special:WhatLinksHere/Q59318277. Shall I undelete the item, so that you can merge the new one? —MisterSynergy (talk) 19:58, 1 December 2020 (UTC) When it comes to creating entries for books and not having them deleted, it's useful to add an external ID like an ISBN number. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 20:05, 1 December 2020 (UTC) Please undelete it and point me to documentation on how to merge entries. Also: @Randykitty: @Jianhui67:: You deleted Q59318277 as \"Completely unreference\" even though it was being used on Wikiversity, as noted above. How can I easily identify other Wikidata entries that I've created and that have been deleted on false claims that it was \"Completely unreferenced\"? This is frightening: I've created lots of Wikidata entries like that and used them extensively. Now at least one has been deleted as \"Completely unreferenced\", when it had been referenced from Wikiversity well over 4 months before it was deleted as \"Completely unreferenced\". Might there be others waiting to be detected? Fifteen months after this deletion, it was not listed as invalid on Wikiversity:Category:Pages with empty citations, as noted above. (An obituary for Mark Twain was reportedly published before he died. He replied, \"the report of my death was an exaggeration.\") What needs to happen to fix your algorithm that reported it as \"Completely unreferenced\", even though it had been referenced from Wikiversity well over 4 months before then? That algorithm should be able to identify references like [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q102407368 Qui sont Julia et Agathe Cagé, mobilisées pour Benoît Hamon jusqu’au bout ? - Elle], which I plan to add to an article I'm planning to create on es.wikipedia.org. (I'm translating fr:Julia Cagé into Spanish. Will your algorithm find [[Bibliographie|Q102407368]] in the French language Wikipedia as a reference? Wikipedia:template:cite Q exists in French but not Spanish, so I'm using a naked URL. I've so far been unable to get a counterpart to Wikipedia:template:cite Q functioning in es.wikipedia.org.) Also, what needs to happen to make the defective algorithm that was used to search for references available to mere mortals, similar to the \"File usage on other wikis\" on Wikimedia Commons? \"What links here\" in Wikidata only identifies other links in Wikidata. What needs to happen so that \"Requests for deletion\" of QIDs trigger a notification to the creator of said Wikidata items? If your defective \"Completely unreferenced\" algorithm knows about uses in Wikipedia but not Wikiversity, in this case I could have replaced the citation to that book to the Wikipedia article on w:Ray Raphael with a reference to this Wikidata item, even if I might not have easily found where I used it in Wikiversity. Secondarily, how will adding an ISBN number prevent a book from being deleted as \"completely unreferenced\"? That does not sound like a \"reference\" to me. Thanks very much for the reply. DavidMCEddy (talk) 21:10, 1 December 2020 (UTC) The item is restored. See Help:Merge how to proceed with the merge process. @MisterSynergy: Help:Merge says, 'There are two ways to perform an automatic merge: the Merge gadget or the Special \"Merge two items\" page.' How can I find the '\"Merge two items\" page.'? I cannot find it, and I'd prefer not to install a gadget if I can avoid it. Thanks, DavidMCEddy (talk) 21:50, 2 December 2020 (UTC) Special:MergeItems —MisterSynergy (talk) 22:29, 2 December 2020 (UTC) This tool shows which of the items that you have created were deleted. —MisterSynergy (talk) 21:49, 1 December 2020 (UTC) Here completely unreferenced means that the item itself has no references for it's information. An ISBN number does provide the opportunity to check the information about a given book externally. Usage of Wikipedia:template:cite Q is practically invisible from Wikidata. I recently opened a thread at https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Contact_the_development_team#Template:Cite_Q_(Q22321052)_and_deletions about this being problematic and you might want to comment to it if you think this is important. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 23:15, 1 December 2020 (UTC) When Q59318277 was nominated for deletion, and when it was deleted, it had a statement author (P50)=Ray Raphael (Q7298002); it took only a second for a Google search to confirm it as a real entity. Furthermore, the author has a Wikipedia biography which discusses the work in detail. There seems to have been no attempt to notify its creator that the item was nominated for deletion, nor to ask them to provide further data. We need to stop valid, albeit incomplete, items from being deleted in this way. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 23:27, 1 December 2020 (UTC) indeed the deletion policy is way too aggressive. I've complained about this many times but the admins insist that aggressive deleting with occasional undeleting is better than adding any process that would slow it down (notifying creators / simple googling /etc). BrokenSegue (talk) 02:32, 2 December 2020 (UTC) First, I have to say that I wouldn't have deleted the item in the state in which it was. Our line about what we delete and not delete comes from discussions on RfD. If you want to move it it makes sense to participate more on RfD. The fact that we don't have notification of creators for RfD is not do to \"admins\" but due to no one writing the bot code for such notifications. Pasleim's DeltaBot would be in a good position to create pings but Pasleim isn't the only person who could do that work. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 09:36, 2 December 2020 (UTC) @ChristianKl: So unfortunately part of the problem is admins (or at least the policy as interpreted by some of them). Many many items are deleted without RfD review. Some admins assert that review would be pointless because deletions here are purely mechanical and thus there is no room for discussion (they say the RfD page is merely to notify admins not a place to reach consensus or discuss). Even if we did notify authors of deletion nominations there is no time limit there and admins can delete things whenever they want. For an example of my grievance see this discussion where multiple admins disagree with your assertion that RfD is for discussion. This isn't just a matter of solving a tooling issue or else I'd be glad to fill that gap. BrokenSegue (talk) 15:56, 2 December 2020 (UTC) @BrokenSegue: In the linked discussion the only admin that replied is RfD is a mix of discussions and requests that are closed without discussion. It's my understanding that the current defacto deletion policy is essentially one of case law that comes from the discussions we have at RfD. It's my impression that deletions that don't go through RfD mostly reflect the RfD case law. The issues involved in deletion are complex. Some of them are issues of tooling while others are issues of policy. The fact that articles can go to RfD without their creators knowing about it is an issue of tooling that could be easily fixed. Creating a new process of speedy deletion that could be used in cases where admins currently delete items directly would also be good, but is complex mix of technology and policy. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 16:23, 2 December 2020 (UTC) @ChristianKl: Well one admin there did say \"For good reasons RfD does not have a minimum discussion period defined or any other formal requirements that need to be respected while resolving cases\" which seems kinda outrageous to me. What use is notifying users if there is no minimum waiting period (and what harm could such a waiting period even cause)? I think both issues are a mix of policy and technology. BrokenSegue (talk) 16:29, 2 December 2020 (UTC) @BrokenSegue: the fact that there's no formal required minimum waiting period doesn't mean that most RfD discussions aren't open for many days. Especially deletion decisions that aren't clear cut are often open for longer periods of time. The harm that a minimum waiting period causes is that it adds extra work to process RfD's. Keeping bureaucratcy down both for users who create items and for admins is valuable. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 18:20, 2 December 2020 (UTC) What should I do to argue more forcefully for the following: Before any Wikidata item is deleted, any human who contributed to such item should be notified, explaining the time at which the item is scheduled for deletion and clear instructions on what needs to happen to cancel that deletion. I think the deletion time should be between 3 and 6 days (72 and 144 hours) from the time of the notice to allow user(s) time to schedule time to research the problem, to figure out what to do, and then do it. This deletion time might be 36 hours in the future IF you make it easy for users to see items to which they contributed after they've been deleted, as suggested below; I don't know how to do that right now. Very compelling labeling of the Wikidata input screen for each new Wikidata item stating clearly and succinctly Wikidata policies for deletion. That labeling should disappear only after the criteria for retention have been met. It should be easy for users to see the details of deleted items to which they contributed with appropriate banners explaining that it has been deleted and cannot be used, though they can copy the contents to new items. It should be much easier than it is presently for people to get help understanding Wikidata policies and recommended practices. I've been a fan of Wikidata since 2017, but I failed to find adequate instructions on how to use it until I got individual help with it in Wikimania 2018 Cape Town. There have been several times since then -- like now -- that I've struggled with whether and how to do something in Wikidata. Some of my posts to \"Wikidata:Project chat\" have gone unanswered. It should be easy, for example, for a user to find how to delete a Wikidata item they created in error; I have not found it so. Permit me to add to my comments above on why this concerns me: I spent most of yesterday on tasks that should have been unnecessary if policies like what I recommend were in place. First, I got a notice that Wikidata item Q59318277 appeared on \"Wikiversity:Category:Pages with empty citations\", even though it was cited on Wikiversity:The Great American Paradox. If that {{cite Q|Q59318277}} had not had a page number following it, I would not likely have been able to overcome that immediate problem within any reasonable period of time. I found that I had added that reference to {{cite Q|Q59318277}} on 2018-12-04. Sadly, my research of my notes from that date failed to identify the document to which Q59318277 referred. Fortunately, the reference included a page number as, \"{{cite Q|Q59318277}}, p. 89.\". I then pulled a dozen books off my shelves and checked p. 89 in each until I found the one I needed. Then I recreated the Wikidata item for that book. Then I began to worry that the replacement I created may itself soon disappear. I still don't know what I need to do to prevent that. I've heard that MAYBE if I add an ISBN number, it might reduce the chances that this replacement for Q59318277 that I created yesterday may itself disappear. However, the criteria for deletion are still not clear to me. IF WIKIDATA ITEMS DISAPPEAR SEEMINGLY AT RANDOM WITHOUT EXPLANATION, IT SHOULD RAISE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER WIKIDATA SHOULD BE USED FOR ANYTHING. I've been a registered Wikidata user since 2012-12-24, but I made only 16 total edits in Wikidata prior to 2018 Wikimania Cape Town, as I mentioned above. I remember attending a presentation on Wikidata at 2017 Wikimania Montreal, but it was not feasible for me to actually use it until I got individual help a year later. It shouldn't be that hard. Yesterday, I learned that 6 Wikidata items I had created had been deleted. Two have since been restored. I still have to create time to figure out what to do with those two. And it's not clear what I need to do to understand what happened to the other four. I may have requested the deletion of one or two of those four, but I doubt if I requested the deletion of all four. I'm in the process of translating the Wikipedia article on w:Julia Cagé from French into Spanish. It's taking a long time, in part because I insist on creating Wikidata items for every reference I use, and I can't find some of their references ;-) And I've encountered a certain level of mild hostility in my requests to have w:Template:Cite Q made available in the Spanish language Wikipedia. I plan to get around that using constructs like [URL comment], e.g., [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q102407368 Qui sont Julia et Agathe Cagé, mobilisées pour Benoît Hamon jusqu’au bout ? - Elle]. If Wikidata items disappear seemingly at random, the mild hostility I've encountered from Spanish language Wikimedians is justified. Thanks for all you to do help make the entire world better informed. DavidMCEddy (talk) 14:27, 2 December 2020 (UTC) @DavidMCEddy:I went through your deleted one's yesterday. One was request by you to be deleted. The other three had no statements and were named Julia et Agathe Cagé, les sœurs douées/Essays in the Political Economy of Information and Taxation/news email. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 18:11, 2 December 2020 (UTC) @ChristianKl: It's difficult to see what the appropriate thing is to do with these. Q96951498 was created 2020-07-04 18:47 and deleted 2020-07-13. It was titled, \"Julia et Agathe Cagé, les sœurs douées\". This seems to be a duplicate of Q96951729, which was created 2020-07-04 18:52, five minutes later. Without being able to look at the edits on Q96951498, I cannot say more about this. If Q96951498 included more than one edit, I think it should be restored, and I should merge it with Q96951729. Wikidata item Q96951729 is currently cited in both the English and French language articles on Julia Cagé, and I plan to cite it as [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q96951729 Julia y Agathe Cagé, las hermanas superdotadas (en francés).] in a Spanish language article on Cagé. Q96950823 was created 2020-07-04 18:37 and also deleted also 2020-07-13. It was titled, \"Essays in the Political Economy of Information and Taxation\". I assume it's the same as Q102421658, which I created on 2020-11-28 with English title, 'Certification of doctoral defense of \"Essays on the political economy of information and taxation\"'. The latter documents the defense of a French-language PhD dissertation by Julia Cagé. Could you please recreate Q96950823, so I can see if it's the same as the certification I have of thesis defense or it's the actual thesis? (It's in French, so the difference between \"in\" and \"on\" in the title is more a function of the translator than the content ;-) Might the \"news email\" document a comment on an email list that I might have cited somewhere? If yes, I think I should examine it as well. After Q59318277 was restored, User:Trade changed \"instance of (P31)\" from \"book (Q571)\" to \"literary work (Q7725634)\". Is \"literary work (Q7725634)\" preferable to \"book (Q571)\" for something like this? This is a carefully documented history of the American Revolution, for which \"book\" sounds more appropriate. More generally, how can I research when one should use Q571, when Q7725634, and when both? Also, I've looked at Help:Merge, and it's not clear to me where I should go from here. I suppose I should try the instructions for \"Automatic merge\" and see what happens. I see that, \"Usually the more recent item should be marked\" as \"duplicated\" and the other as the \"main\" item. Does that mean I should start at Q59318277 and merge Q102951790 into it? Thanks again. DavidMCEddy (talk) 19:50, 2 December 2020 (UTC) @DavidMCEddy: I undeleted Certification of doctoral defense of \"Essays in the political economy of information and taxation\" (Q96950823): Documentation of 2013 doctoral defense at EHESS and Q66424630: no description as well. Given that both lack statements they are not viable in their current form. @ChristianKl: Thanks. I looked at Certification of doctoral defense of \"Essays in the political economy of information and taxation\" (Q96950823): Documentation of 2013 doctoral defense at EHESS and Q66424630: no description. You're right: They \"both lack statements\". I will try to merge Certification of doctoral defense of \"Essays in the political economy of information and taxation\" (Q96950823): Documentation of 2013 doctoral defense at EHESS with 'Certification of doctoral defense of \"Essays on the political economy of information and taxation\" (Q102421658)'. Since no other Wikidata item links to Q66424630: no description, I suggest you speedily delete it before someone else tries to use it ;-) DavidMCEddy (talk) 21:33, 2 December 2020 (UTC) As far as the topic of books goes https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Books#Bibliographic_properties explain our modelling. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 20:59, 2 December 2020 (UTC) @ChristianKl: Am I reading your https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Books#Bibliographic_properties correctly to suggest that I should avoid using \"book (Q571)\", because it's too general, and instead use \"literary work (Q7725634)\", because it's more specific? And where I've assigned both, I should delete \"book (Q571)\"? A related question is when to use \"news (Q38926)\" vs. \"news article (Q5707594)\"? I've recently been assigning both. However, if \"literary work (Q7725634)\" is preferred to \"book (Q571)\" because it's more specific, then \"news article (Q5707594)\" should be preferred to \"news (Q38926)\" for a news report that I've found in a news medium? And, again, where I've assigned both, I should delete \"news (Q38926)\" in favor of \"news article (Q5707594)\"? Thanks again, DavidMCEddy (talk) 21:20, 2 December 2020 (UTC) Theoretically, the place that should document the answer to that question is https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Periodicals . It currently doesn't speak about news aricles explictely but about article (Q191067). To me that suggests using news article (Q5707594) is the way to go here. At the same time it would likely be good if the documentation would explictely say so, so I raised the issue of being more specific on the discussion page of that Wikiproject. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 22:49, 2 December 2020 (UTC) As long as it's not visible from Wikidata whether or not items are used with w:Template:Cite Q and thus that has no inpact on deletion decisions, I do agree that skepticism towards it is warrented. Even if you do think we should generally delete fewer items, having access to that information seem valuable and that's why I created the topic over at Contact the development team. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 18:11, 2 December 2020 (UTC) Making policy more legible is not something you archieve by forcefully arguing for it but by actually doing the work of working on making policies more legible and doing tasks like answering questions on the project chat. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 18:11, 2 December 2020 (UTC) This is why we need to introduce a speedy deletion process (and change existing deletion to a 7-day process).--GZWDer (talk) 15:46, 2 December 2020 (UTC) I strongly agree and proposed such a thing in this long discussion but got pushback (and others have made similar proposals [1] and [2]). It seems @MisterSynergy: opposes this kind of reform. BrokenSegue (talk) 16:09, 2 December 2020 (UTC) @BrokenSegue: when it comes to create a proposal for such a system it's important to understand the technical features that our current system has. I'm generally willing to work to formulate policy. In the linked discussion there's an open question about whether abuse filters can be used to mark a property in a way that it can only be added by users with a specific right but removed by everyone. If that's possible we can go further and write a speedy deletion system based on that principle, but without knowing it there's no way to move forward with that specific way of implementing it. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 18:15, 2 December 2020 (UTC) Any speedy deletion process that does NOT honestly and effectively address the concerns I raised above is user hostile and drives volunteers away from the Wikimedia project. It is a threat to the sustainability of what we are trying to do here. After I had translated the first 20% of the French language Wikipedia article on w:Julia Cagé into Spanish, someone speedily deleted what I had done. That already included 7 references documenting her status as an economist with PhDs from both Harvard and Science Po and her status as an expert in the economics of media and democracy. The person who speedily deleted what I wrote did not respond to my comments about why I thought it should not be deleted. I've gotten zero response to requests for information on what needs to happen to have that article restored. You want to know why Wikimedia projects have such a hard time recruiting and keeping volunteers? This is one of the reasons. I agree that there should be speedy deletion processes, but they should not be managed in such a user hostile fashion as I've experienced recently with es.wikipedia.org and Wikidata. DavidMCEddy (talk) 16:11, 2 December 2020 (UTC) Wikidata is very inclusive, at least compared to most Wikipedia projects. The biggest gap (as discussed above and elsewhere) seems to be whether the Wikidata item has incoming links from certain external projects (e.g. Wikipedia references, OpenStreetMap). Should being cited in a Wikipedia article be enough to make a Wikidata item notable? Should being in OpenStreetMap? Not absolutely, but it ought to move the needle towards inclusion. Unfortunately, other than the sitelinks, there is simply no mechanism for a deleting admin to detect such links and it is not explicitly part of the notability criteria. A possible mitigation would be to create some sort of \"deletion review\" tool that would report such external references. Looking at the earlier discussions (and ignoring the specific implementation details), it seems like people are asking for: an easy way for any trusted user to propose deletion of an item; and a reasonable opportunity to object to proposed deletions, including notifications and delay. I would favour such a process. People are also asking for ways to view deleted content, which I sympathise with, but it would be hard to provide without raising concerns about hosting copyright- or BLP-violating content. Bovlb (talk) 19:01, 2 December 2020 (UTC) @Bovlb: in addition to what you said, admins who delete a lot of items also don't want to create 1000s of RfD's per week but a way to delete items with less overhead. If we had a way where an admin could tag an item for deletion and if nobody objects it gets automatically deleted after X days and if someone objects it goes to RfD that would help with that concern. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 19:25, 2 December 2020 (UTC) In the English Wikipedia there is PROD (proposed deletion), which works exactly like this (but anybody can PROD articles, not only admins).--Ymblanter (talk) 20:09, 2 December 2020 (UTC) we have the tools to implement this today. just make a new property called \"wikidata review status\" and have people set it to \"proposed deletion\". BrokenSegue (talk) 20:37, 2 December 2020 (UTC) The difference between Wikidata and Wikipedia is that plenty of pages on Wikidata get a lot less attention and have fewer people who have it on their watchlist. I don't think that every user should be able to delete items that are on nobodies watchlist. On Wikipedia I would limit that to admins and either a new right or to people with the rollbacker right. Basically, only people who can be trusted to understand how our deletion policy works should be able to delete items without interaction from other people. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 20:52, 2 December 2020 (UTC) I thought more about the issue and wrote a draft that just needs a bot and no other technical features: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:ChristianKl/Draft:ProposeDeletion#Detecting_manual_removal_of_propose_deletion_for_reason I'm happy for input. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 11:12, 3 December 2020 (UTC) @Ymblanter: I looked at the PROD policy and according to it there's admin review of items which means workload. Here we want a system that doesn't produce additional human workload and thus it makes sense to restrict the right to use the mechanism. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 19:28, 3 December 2020 (UTC) PROD indeed has admin review. If we have the system without additional admin review, the only way out is restrict the mechanism to admins, otherwise users without an admin flag get an opportunity to delete articles - which, I believe, is not something that the community generally supports.--Ymblanter (talk) 19:32, 3 December 2020 (UTC) FWIW, the linked proposal restricts this to the rollbackers user group. BrokenSegue (talk) 20:09, 3 December 2020 (UTC) It is unfortunate, but the best way to prevent deletion of valid entries is to have as much cross linking as possible. The author should be linked, and at the author page notable_work=X. As mentioned the ISBN number and the Google Book ID as well as the Amazon ID should be included. The more you add the less likely the unfortunate deletion will occur. If the book has a specific topic, you can add described_by_source=X from that topic. When an item is linked from another item, autodeletion is prevented because the item has a structural need. --RAN (talk) 14:11, 4 December 2020 (UTC) Wikidata for mythical namesInviting participants of the WikiProject Ancient Greece to join the Linked Pasts session on Exploring Names in Wikidata, Mythical and Otherwise on Dec 8, 2020 UTC 13:00.

Ayack (talk) 18:24, 2 December 2020 (UTC) Maybe we should get out of the business of assigning genders to first names altogether? We've settled on instance of (P31)human (Q5) for people, so why should it be different for their names? Between cultural differences and changes in law and society regarding both names and genders, the distinction is complicated at best and only getting worse. Since we link people with their first names, data on their use in the so-called real world is just a query away, and the distinction via instance of (P31) is both duplicative and less accurate. --Matthias Winkelmann (talk) 18:07, 2 December 2020 (UTC) I've stopped assigning gender to humans unless their preferred pronouns are clearly documented somewhere.

At Wikidata we don't try to set standards but allow different jurisdictions and cultures to express themselves. In Germany it's legally relevant whether or not a name is a female or male name as parents are not allowed to name children with a name that goes against their gender. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 10:36, 4 December 2020 (UTC) Perhaps we could find a way to express that a particular name is considered gendered by a particular government body, but that still doesn't imply that we need more than one item for the name.

Starting with the top, we have:King's Pawn Game (Q1631907) subclass of (P279) chess opening (Q103632).Open Game (Q753060) subclass of (P279) King's Pawn Game (Q1631907).When we get to King's Knight Opening (Q1237452), it is instance of (P31) chess opening (Q103632), and also is subclass of (P279) Open Game (Q753060). This makes sense because the King's Knight Opening is a chess opening and also it defines a class of chess openings which begin with that sequence, which is also true. What I don't understand is why Open Game (Q753060) isn't similarly instance of (P31) chess opening (Q103632)? It should be, right? Also, thinking about the \"terminal nodes\" of the graph defined by the subclass relation starting at chess opening, something like Semi-Slav Defense (Q1570575) seems like a terminal node (query). There are no subclasses of it, and no instances of it. By leaving the statement of Semi-Slav Defense (Q1570575) subclass of (P279) Queen's Gambit (Q107925), are we saying essentially that \"There are a whole class of chess openings further branched from this one, we just don't have names for them?\" Or is it just a relic of how the data was modeled? And wouldn't Semi-Slav Defense (Q1570575) instance of (P31) Queen's Gambit (Q107925) be more correct than chess opening (Q103632)? Given that, wouldn't the initial example, King's Knight Opening (Q1237452) be better to instance of (P31) Open Game (Q753060) instead of the generic chess opening (Q103632)?Basically, I'm suggesting that chess openings are both an instance and a subclass of the chess opening they derive from. Does this make sense? And should the subclass relationship be pruned from openings where there are no named/known instances? Thanks!--Audiodude (talk) 06:25, 3 December 2020 (UTC) @Audiodude: Not sure I entirely follow, but it seems like these are modeled so that chess opening (Q103632) is a metaclass, and the classes of openings would have instances (if they existed) that were occasions when that opening was actually used in a game? Just because something is a class with no instances here in Wikidata doesn't mean that its \"real world\" (abstract) meaning wouldn't actually have instances of some sort. ArthurPSmith (talk) 18:47, 3 December 2020 (UTC) Thanks for the response and the welcome message! I guess it makes sense to think about something analogous that's more basic, like colors. alice blue (Q372669) instance of (P31) color (Q1075), but also alice blue (Q372669) subclass of (P279) blue (Q1088). So following that example, it would make sense to model the chess openings the same way right? So King's Knight Opening should be \"instance of\" chess opening, but \"subclass of\" the specific chess opening that it derives from (in this case Open Game). The only thing about this modeling that strikes me odd is that you don't end up with any colors that are \"instances of\" blue. And is alice blue really a \"class\" of colors? Thanks! --Audiodude (talk) 20:54, 3 December 2020 (UTC) @Audiodude: The difference between instance/subclass for non-physical things is really subtle sometimes and I think even experienced people get confused. Some of this is just trying to be consistent within the same realm. Does it make sense to say there is an \"instance of\" blue anywhere? Maybe a particular frequency? Really blue is a rough region of color space and other blue-ish colors are subregions of blue. I don't think adding chess opening (Q103632) to Open Game (Q753060) would hurt but it's a little redundant. Have you seen Help:Basic membership properties? BrokenSegue (talk) 21:10, 3 December 2020 (UTC) Thanks for the reply! I can see how it's tricky, yes. And yes I was referring to that help document specifically when working on these issues, and the key that struck me was that for an entity to be a subclass of another entity, both of them must be classes. Looking at ArthurPSmith's answer above, it seems like it's okay to have a class \"Semi-Slav Defense\" of chess openings, even if there are no entities in Wikidata that are instances of that class. What concerns me more is setting \"Semi-Slave Defence\" to be instance of \"chess opening\" instead of instance of \"Queen's Gambit\" because if we follow that practice, the \"class\" Queen's Gambit is never going to have any instance members. Thanks! --Audiodude (talk) 21:17, 3 December 2020 (UTC) Yeah I don't think it matters if a class never has an instance in wikidata. I think you could safely delete that \"instance of\" but optimally there would be a \"Wikiproject Chess\" that would come to an agreement on this. BrokenSegue (talk) 21:24, 3 December 2020 (UTC) @Audiodude: If they are all forms of chess opening, could it work to just make all the openings a tree of subclasses under chess opening (Q103632)? IMHO the instances arise when an opening is used in a notable game. Pauljmackay (talk) 15:16, 5 December 2020 (UTC) Please merge Westerplatte Monument (Q825098) and Westerplatte Monument (Q67012160). TIA. Also, how many more years before we get a nice merge button? I read the merging instructions and got bored after two minutes of trying to figure which version is superior (obsolete).

As you can see, that has a catalog code (P528) value of \"37\" in catalogue vice-county (Q7925010) (otherwise \"VC37\").The equivalent item for the vice-county of Warwickshire, VC38, is missing, I can find no trace of it having been merged onto another item.Warwickshire (Q67575123) claims to be both historic county of England (Q1138494) and historic county of England (Q1138494) (which is self-contrdictory); but the former is a more recent addition, not part of a merge, and no other items redirect to it.Perhaps the original VC38 item was deleted? If so, how can it be traced, and restored? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 19:24, 5 December 2020 (UTC) Looks like it was merged into Warwickshire (Q23140), not Warwickshire (Q67575123).

Is it acceptable with items like reverse engineer (Q103910331) that refers to the action of reverse engineering (Q269608). If yes, how do we best link them together. Do we need a new \"action of\" property?--So9q (talk) 13:46, 6 December 2020 (UTC) When creating items like this I think it's best to ask: \"What value does the new item create?\" reverse engineer (Q103910331) is an item with only one statement and no external references and thus of questionable use. I think the notability of the item is questionable as it stands currently. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 14:28, 6 December 2020 (UTC) Thanks for the input. Its very useful to map to the sense on a lexeme like demontera (L55465) and reverse engineer (L347677) which is a structural need because for tools like MachtSinn we connect the lexemes and the item by matching on the alias and the english verb \"reverse engineer\" does not match anything in reverse engineering (Q269608) right now and I'm hesitant of adding all possible verb forms of the actions related to the concepts on the item. Which is the less bad route to take? A new item that describes and action and can hold all the aliases and act as a link between the languages or items with a truckload of aliases for every conceivable verb related to the concept?--So9q (talk) 18:09, 6 December 2020 (UTC) I haven't done much with lexemes, so I don't have a strong opinion about whether that's the best way to model this use-case but it seems to me reasonable to have the item for that purpose. In this case, it would help with discussing the item if you would actually link it the way you believe it's intended to be linked. It's better to discuss the problem then to discuss an item in isolation of it's usage. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 18:28, 6 December 2020 (UTC) I agree, sorry for not being clear, I have not linked it because it is tedious to do manually which is why I'm creating the items, waiting for MachtSinn to update and then use that tool to create the linking with little effort.--So9q (talk) 18:39, 6 December 2020 (UTC) It's generally useful to start by mapping out a structure manually and then when the structure is clear automate the process. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 20:13, 6 December 2020 (UTC) Both are fine, and reverse engineer (Q103910331) is the value to use with occupation (P106) (although there is no such use yet). I have connected both items with field of this occupation (P425) and practiced by (P3095). —MisterSynergy (talk) 14:46, 6 December 2020 (UTC) While I agree that we have a structural need for that occupation, the act of reverse engineering called \"reverse engineer\" is not the same thing as the occupation of \"reverse engineer\". ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 14:57, 6 December 2020 (UTC) I do not understand your concern. Can you please elaborate? Thanks, —MisterSynergy (talk) 15:00, 6 December 2020 (UTC) @MisterSynergy: You did remove the existing instance of (P31) statement and turned the item into something of a different instance of (P31). ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 15:01, 6 December 2020 (UTC) Yes, I normalized it according to common practices. But how does this relate to your comment above, and how is this an answer to my request for clarification? —MisterSynergy (talk) 15:04, 6 December 2020 (UTC) So9q asked whether or not an item about the act was fine or not. Turning the item into something else then it was and then saying that the new thing is fine evades the question about whether or not having an item for the thing that he proposed is fine. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 15:11, 6 December 2020 (UTC) @MisterSynergy, ChristianKl: I agree with ChristianKl here, you hijacked my perfectly good item :). But doing that you reacted to my question by turning the item into a \"more useful\" normalized item. In its current form its not suitable to link to the verb \"reverse engineer\" because that's not what it means anymore. I guess we have to chisel out a solution that solve all our needs here. See above for my two suggestions, but there might be other ways to solve the issue of what the lexeme verbs should link to and how to do that linking effectively (with tools like MachtSinn for example).--So9q (talk) 18:09, 6 December 2020 (UTC) I see. The lexeme/the verb reverse engineer (L347677) was not on the table here when I wrote my answer and modified reverse engineer (Q103910331), and there was no reason to assume that it plays a role here as we usually do not describe words/terms in the item namespace. Now I am not the most experienced editor regarding lexemes, but I think there is item for this sense (P5137) and maybe a few other properties to link from the lexeme to the activity reverse engineer (Q103910331) or the discipline reverse engineering (Q269608) (not sure which exactly fits here). See Template:Lexicographical properties for an overview of existing lexeme related properties. —MisterSynergy (talk) 18:55, 6 December 2020 (UTC) Yeah I see now that I completely forgot to mention that in the beginning. Sorry about that. item for this sense (P5137) is very nice. We already have translation based on it via Ordia, see https://ordia.toolforge.org/L37303-S1 for an example.--So9q (talk) 19:01, 6 December 2020 (UTC) Interesting turn, maybe \"reverse engineer\" (Q103910331) is probably an \"occupation\" as it's an activity, not profession. So it does cover the action of Q269608. --- Jura 18:14, 6 December 2020 (UTC) Oh, I had not thought about that, maybe its both an occupation and an intentional action then? I leave that up to you and @MisterSynergy: to figure out. As long as it can meaningfully link the verbs for reverse engineer in different languages I'm happy :)--So9q (talk) 18:42, 6 December 2020 (UTC) Advice on using Wikidata for vocabulary data I'd like to add Items to Wikidata for foreign-language words, phrases, and sentences, with properties representing the information needed to create a flash card or vocabulary study list for a fluent English speaker studying that language. These would be used to support foreign language learning content on both Wikibooks and Wikiversity.Right now, vocabulary is hand-written into lessons, the way it would be in a physical textbook. Sometimes a word will appear in multiple contexts (in more than one lesson, in flash cards and vocabulary lists, etc.) or more than one project (for example, in a Wikibooks language text and a Wikiversity language resource). This is less than ideal because it requires extra work and it invites inconsistency.Having structured flash card data could also support other tools--for instance, customizable flash cards (e.g., showing things like parts of speech and gender in English or in the language itself, or with/without examples), and would make export to other tools like Anki easier.I first tried to figure out a way to use Wiktionary data, but (1) Wiktionary only works for words, not most phrases or sentences, and (2) Wiktionary content is too detailed and too loosely structured for a flash card. I thought of creating a Lua-based lookup table, but for long vocabulary lists that gets resource-intensive very quickly.So my thought was: for each vocabulary item, create a Wikidata Item, which in pseudocode might look something like: Item: aisling
language: ga
vocabulary type: lemma
(link to Wiktionary entry)

definition 1:
 meaning 1: dream, vision
 meaning 2: a type of poem
 part of speech: verbal noun
 gender: feminine
 declension: 2

definition 2:
 meaning: dream
 part of speech: verb
 conjugation: 2 Wikibooks/Wikiversity editors could then choose to display these as: aisling: dream, vision aisling: dream, vision; a type of poem (n.) aisling: drean, vision; a type of poem (n. f. 2nd) dream (v. 2nd) and so on. I'd be using this initially on my own projects (in the Irish language) but would try to design it in such a way that the general syntax/taxonomy could be used for any language.I guess my question is: is this the sort of thing Wikidata is for? I'm experienced with other wiki projects and with structured data generally, but new to Wikidata. Should I just Be Bold and start creating content and see if anyone complains? Are there projects out there already doing vocabulary-type data? Would it be a problem if the only \"authority\" for a given phrase or sentence was that it's used in a book written for Wikibooks? Any feedback would be appreciated. --Chapka (talk) 12:26, 6 December 2020 (UTC) In Wikidata we have different datatypes. Items are not appropriate for vocabulary but lexemes are. On Wikidata you mostly can't just make up your own general syntax. General syntax gets created via property proposals which involve community discussions. Take a look at our existing lexemes and where their syntax allows for what you want. Citing authorities is not necessary for creating new lexemes. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 12:47, 6 December 2020 (UTC) Thanks. I will poke around at the L entries and see if there's something I can latch on to there--although there are some problems I can see right away (e.g. words with different meanings, genders, etc. but identical spelling might need to be on the same flash card, and you might not want to pull in all possible obscure meanings for one vocabulary list). But it's a lot closer to what I'm looking for. --Chapka (talk) 19:12, 6 December 2020 (UTC) You could also have a flashcard per sense (a meaning).

If the exact lodge has an entry I use that, as here: Special:WhatLinksHere/Q64966925. --RAN (talk) 18:23, 20 November 2020 (UTC) If the information of the exact lodge is available I would create an item for it and use it. member_of=freemasonry (Q41726) looks better to me then member_of=masonic lodge (Q1454597). ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 18:29, 20 November 2020 (UTC) Shouldn't the value of member of (P463) be an actual organization? Not convinced that the changed from \"instance of\" to \"instance or subclass of\" for the type constraint was a good idea [3]. --- Jura 11:38, 22 November 2020 (UTC) The exact lodge is the only one that fits exactly, do you think we need to create something new that fits \"member_of=\" better, or can we modify one to be a better match? We need something to let people know someone was a mason, all the other fraternal organizations have an exact match such as \"member_of=Phi_Bet_Kappa\" or \"member_of=Schiners\" or \"member_of=International_Order_of_Odd_Fellows\" or \"member_of=Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks\". Currently we are split among the various choices I mentioned above. --RAN (talk) 00:45, 24 November 2020 (UTC) While Phi Beta Kappa or the IOOF are each a single organization, the Masons are not. Most lodges are affiliated and recognize one another, but there are definitely exceptions (e.g. Continental Freemasonry). - 01:55, 24 November 2020 (UTC)~ I was of the understanding that the lodges do form an organization together, if that's not how Masons work then I agree that individual lodges should only be used. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 14:07, 24 November 2020 (UTC) As I say, most do, some don't. I don't know my way around this in detail; someone else probably does and could weigh in with a better explanation. A good example is that the Order of the Eastern Star accepts women as equal members (and always has), which the F&AM still don't allow. - Jmabel (talk) 21:03, 24 November 2020 (UTC) Modelling individual lodges (even if we can reliably work that out) sounds like it could get very complicated - there are (were?) thousands of them, and presumably a lot will only ever have one person linked in Wikidata. 21:49, 24 November 2020 (UTC) I don't see any problem with thousands of item for Masonic lodges. Even when in the beginning there's only a link to one person, as Wikipedia grows the amount of links will go and the information that two people were in the same Masonic lodge is very interesting information that previously wasn't documented. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 13:51, 1 December 2020 (UTC) I think the problem is that an obituary may only mention that a person was a \"mason\" and we need some way to show that, so we can aggregate all the masons in a single search, perhaps someone may want to compare membership numbers in various fraternal organizations. Currently we have a mix of the examples I gave in my initial question. Even if only temporary, we need to harmonize on one. I agree \"member of=individual lodge\" is best for the future, if someone wants to tackle adding them all. --RAN (talk) 22:35, 2 December 2020 (UTC) @Richard Arthur Norton (1958- ):Given that we now have P8929 (P8929) it might be a good for a Mason.

Accordingly, the original model should be restore, i.e. Vermont Class 1 senate seat (Q101435082) replaced with Vermont (Q16551), etc.Also, I don't think any of the requested references have been provided for statements like \"Vermont Class 1 senate seat (Q101435082)\" subclass of \"United States senate constituency\", suggesting that it's a database artifact.Discussion was at Wikidata:Project_chat/Archive/2020/11#Representing_United_States_Senate_classes. There was some further discussion at Wikidata:Project_chat#Cleaning_up_old_model_for_US_Senate_data (mainly about something else).If further information is needed about the cleanup, please bring it up. --- Jura 18:03, 6 December 2020 (UTC) There's little room for doubt that it is Senators, not their (in our terms) districts, that are 'divided as equally as may be into three Classes' (United States Constitution Article 1 Section 3 Clause 2) and that the constituency is the State (United States Constitution Article 1 Section 3 Clause 1}. Vermont Class 1 senate seat et al remain as objectionable today as they did when coined a few weeks ago. --Tagishsimon (talk) 18:14, 6 December 2020 (UTC) Also not sure where we are with the invented end-dates for incumbents, as if we possess a functioning crystal ball, and against convention & good sense. Whole thing quite depressing. --Tagishsimon (talk) 18:19, 6 December 2020 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: All your questions were answered in the thread cited. If you were truly concerned you should have followed up there. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 23:23, 6 December 2020 (UTC) The end date problem was fixed in the meantime (see discussion above). We just need to keep an eye on these things and watch out for artifacts. --- Jura 18:43, 6 December 2020 (UTC) This is nothing more than harassment. Please stop. You had ample opportunity to contribute to the discussion you cited. I tried to have a non-public discussion with you about your behavior which you refused to engage in. For those late to this discussion the major points are that Jura has been complaining about this model for over two years but has put in no effort into the underlying data itself. The full Senate record was spotty, inconsistent and occasionally wrong before this effort was taken up. The entire Senate history is now complete and consistent with enough info to reproduce pages such as this one. This would have been impossible with the model Jura proposed and certainly with the data as it existed. Tagishsimon's complaint is basically a bike shed argument as should be clear from reading the thread cited. Both of these individuals have insisted on making personal insults a feature of their criticism despite repeated efforts to get them to engage specifically about the data itself. To be fair, Tagishsimon's criticisms have been more on point whereas Jura's have never been. If this continues, I will follow up as appropriate. Regards, Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 23:23, 6 December 2020 (UTC) It's also worth noting that Jura did not ping me on this proposal though I have put in the bulk of the work here. This is not an attempt to contribute to the community but rather an attempt to harass an individual. Regards, Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 23:33, 6 December 2020 (UTC) I'm not sure it counts as \"cleaning up\" when this wasn't very widely applied in the first place. Of the ~2000 old-style claims still present, only ~600 have any P768 qualifiers, so less than one in three items actually used it. This is the first time a data model has actually been rolled out consistently across all Senators and actually makes the data useful. Personally, I think what we have is fine. If it's desired to return the state rather than the class seat then it's really easy to write a query to do so (example with state, example with class). In the earlier discussion I wrote up some lengthy notes on the options for modelling classes and states at Wikidata:Project_chat/Archive/2020/11#Options_for_modelling but it didn't get much traction. I think any of them are fine, really, but I'd much prefer it if we showed that one of the alternatives is clearly better than what we have, not just that it's what was sort-of there before.

ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 08:12, 8 December 2020 (UTC) When should an item use position held (P39) and/or noble title (P97)? It appears that Wikidata items inconsistently use position held (P39) and noble title (P97): Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor (Q150966) P39 only: Holy Roman Emperor (Q181765) Baldwin IV of Jerusalem (Q296850) P97 only: King of Jerusalem (Q693614) Rollo (Q273773) Both P39 and P97: Duke of Normandy (Q460244) Elizabeth II (Q9682) P39 only: duchess (Q4593319) P97 only: monarch of the Dominion of Ceylon (Q34518803) Both P39 and P97: monarch of the United Kingdom (Q9134365) Could I please have some guidance on when to use P39 only, when to use P97 only, and when to use the same value for both properties? -Thunderforge (talk) 02:13, 7 December 2020 (UTC) @Thunderforge: I would use both, even though redundant in these cases. I would also make sure each noble_title is also listed as a position as I did at \"King of Jerusalem\". See: Talk:Q693614 where positions automatically create succession charts. For a completed chart see for example: Talk:Q11696. Almost all succession of positions are full of errors at Wikidata and need to be cleaned up. --RAN (talk) 21:15, 8 December 2020 (UTC) Importing references from Wikipedia articles? Is there any solution to automatically import works (to create Wikitada items from them) referenced on Wikipedia to Wikidata? --TRANSviada (talk) 19:23, 8 December 2020 (UTC) Object with more than one role with conflicting properties The question here is how to handle cases where one and the same thing has different roles, where for each role some of the properties would have different values.My current example: there are protected areas (nature protection) which are under national protection (nature reserve (Q1627961)) and international protection (Special Area of Conservation (Q1191622)) at the same time. It's exactly or nearly the identical area, and of course it's covered by a single Wikipedia article and a single Commons category. However, the national and internation protection have different date of inception (P571), different WDPA ID (P809) und sometimes a slightly different area (P2046).When I asked in the German-speaking project chat I was told to make two distinct Wikidata objects and connect them via territory overlaps (P3179). I tried that and naturally wanted to have a Wikidata Infobox for both Wikidata items in the commons Category, which yielded an error. Asking about that, I was told that the two items should be merged and one of the protection status should be included as has part(s) of the class (P2670), assigning all the properties of that protection status as qualifiers to that property. Even though I don't like the asymmetry of the two roles, and it seemed to me to contradict the intended semantics of has part(s) of the class (P2670), I tried it and it led to warnings about properties not being allowed as qualifiers.So now I try to ask here, which I consider the \"highest authority\" for such questions. I really wonder what's the correct way of handling such a situation.When I thought about it further, I came to the conclusion that a possible solution could be something similar to heritage designation (P1435), just for protection of nature rather than protection of cultural heritage. A single object could have more than one value for that property, and IDs like WDPA ID (P809), Natura 2000 site ID (P3425), and Common Database on Designated Areas ID (P4762) should be allowed as qualifiers. Probably we'd also want a qualifier like \"affected area\" or \"protected area\" for cases where the exact protection area differs slightly.What do you think? --Reinhard Müller (talk) 12:11, 8 December 2020 (UTC) They must be different items here, its not possible to put all the data into qualifiers of one statement. Take for example the area (P2046) - often the law which created the protected area states one roundabout area, then later the map is digitized and a slightly different value shows up, then eventually some parts are added to the protected area, and there's another value with a different start time (P580). If all is in one statement with lots of qualifiers, its impossible to show different values with different references or different times. Its never a good idea to model the data to fit with a technical limitation - maybe someone can create a commons infobox with the item ID as parameter, and then its easy to show both in one category. Ahoerstemeier (talk) 13:37, 8 December 2020 (UTC) Ahoerstemeier is right. Conflating multiple different entities into one item is generally bad.

(It's a bit of a mess, and I just tried to align the description(s) with the constraints) You'd need some item for either the TV program (qualified with date and full work available at URL (P953)) or the specific episode. --Matthias Winkelmann (talk) 02:51, 9 December 2020 (UTC) Linking a redirect? I noticed that Four Seasons Total Landscaping (Q101248727) was successfully linked to Wikipedia, even though the page on Wikipedia is a redirect to Four Seasons Total Landscaping press conference (Q101424698). I'd like to do the same for some other pages, such as Ruth Chandler Williamson Gallery (Q18325652) and w:Ruth Chandler Williamson Gallery, but the documentation at w:Template:Wikidata redirect is lacking and I can't escape the error message it keeps giving me when I try to make the connection. Help? {{u|Sdkb}} talk 21:13, 29 November 2020 (UTC) At the moment work on the ticket that allows easy creation is stalled (@Mohammed_Sadat_(WMDE): might provide information on when this changes). In the meantime you have to deactivate the redirect on the Wikipedia page shortly then set the redirect in Wikidata (at a time where the Wikipedia page is not a redirect) afterwards you can reedit the Wikipedia page to turn it into a redirect. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 21:49, 29 November 2020 (UTC) @ChristianKl: There was an RfC to allow the addition of some redirects to items. However, we need to make sure that people are aware of the consequences that change will bring. Lydia wrote some more about that here. The next steps might not have been clear there, but in order to move forward with the ticket that you referred, we would like to have a look at the option to generate the links based on statements first. For that, we’ll need to collect a few specific cases where people want to link to redirects and then see which statements could provide a large number of them without too much overhead. Who can help collect such a list? -Mohammed Sadat (WMDE) (talk) 12:30, 5 December 2020 (UTC) @Mohammed Sadat (WMDE): @Lydia_Pintscher_(WMDE): Whether or not sitelinks to redirects are allowed seems to me like a policy question and thus up to the community.

ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 12:54, 5 December 2020 (UTC) @ChristianKl: In what sense do you think the RfC that Mohammed Sadat linked to was not an expression of the will of the community? --Tagishsimon (talk) 14:41, 5 December 2020 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: I think it was an expression of the will of the community to use sitelinks to redirects. Mohammed Sadat (WMDE) seems to argue that we should disregard it and instead see whether we can archieve the functionality of referercing redirects (or the pages they target) with mechanisms other then sitelinks. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 14:45, 5 December 2020 (UTC) Ah. You're relying on a very specific definition of sitelink, then. Don't get me wrong; if we are to have sitelinks to redirects, then having them in the same place as existing language wiki links, and marked (and hence machine-distinguishable) in much the way that we currently mark featured articles, would seem to be the way forward. I'm not sure I've seen any articulation of why that approach is technically problematic. Blessed if I know why Lydia launched into a riff on using statements to generate redirect sitelinks (adding redirects seems to be something users would do once the facility is provided) rather than addressing the question of storage arrangements for the data. --Tagishsimon (talk) 15:10, 5 December 2020 (UTC) @Sdkb: If you would like this to be fixed, please vote for meta:Community Wishlist Survey 2021/Wikidata/Link Wikipedia redirects to Wikidata items.

I personally would rather see all entries like Victor O. Frazer (Q2522517) use the same position held (P39) claim and use located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) to refer to which territory they represent, but my immediate concern is not to co-ingle these entries with United States representative (Q13218630) to make it easier to do a proper reconciliation of the latter. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 07:37, 9 December 2020 (UTC) I think there are three questions: (1) are they representatives? The answer is probably no, so non-voting member of the U.S. House of Representatives (Q5253588) shouldn't a subclass of United States representative (Q13218630). (2) is a specific position with just members from different territories? If the answer is yes, non-voting member of the U.S. House of Representatives (Q5253588) shouldn't have any subclasses. If they vary, we should probably have subclasses. (3) has the situation for (1) or (2) changed over time? If not, just one approach is sufficient. --- Jura 17:24, 6 December 2020 (UTC) WikiCite question Can I add links as a QID for citations? For example, if I wanted to cite https://noticias.uol.com.br/ultimas-noticias/efe/2018/05/10/edificio-prestes-maia-o-maior-simbolo-das-ocupacoes-na-america-latina.htm , could I do it? Tetizeraz (talk) 01:18, 9 December 2020 (UTC) Tetizeraz Yes, absolutely! For use here on Wikidata, it's more common not to use references to use reference URL (P854) in the reference section. But you can also create an item: see ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’ Leads Saturn Awards Nominees (Q24090324) for one of currently about 20,000 examples. Unfortunately, there isn't any automation that I'm aware of. You would need to identify it as appropriate, such as instance of (P31)article (Q103184) (or something more specific, such as letter to the editor (Q651270), news article (Q5707594) etc.) and provide the URL with full work available at URL (P953). I'm not familiar with how these are used on other wikis, but on Wikidata, you'd then link to it with stated in (P248). In principle, it is fairly easy to fill in additional information such as authors, publication dates, and publication automatically, at least for professional publications that cointain such data in the source code for search engines, twitter, etc. (and title, as well, but you'd usually add that because the Item creation form asks for it). With that in mind, and for use within Wikidata, I'd tend to suggest to prioritize adding data that cannot be gathered automatically, such as quotation (P1683) before creating additional items for the publication, authors, etc. Opinions might differ on that, however. --Matthias Winkelmann (talk) 02:17, 9 December 2020 (UTC) Matthias Winkelmann something like this? Prestes Maia Building, the greatest symbol of squatting in Latin America (Q104048129) Tetizeraz (talk) 06:23, 9 December 2020 (UTC) Tetizeraz Yes, that is excellent! It's probably more detailed than the average item for heads of state. Since I'm a fan of such overkill, I've added a few things, such as creating an item for the author. The one complaint the system had was the archive URL, which it expects as a qualifier on the main URL. But the archive URL can always be derived if needed, so it's not strictly neccessary. Most useful among the things I adde is probably main subject (P921), because these can't be derived automatically, and it's something that people are likely to search for. If you click on \"What links here\" on the building's item, it now links the article, as well. --Matthias Winkelmann (talk) 11:51, 9 December 2020 (UTC) Finally fixing the Bonnie and Clyde problem If you would like to see the Bonnie and Clyde problem finally fixed on Wikidata, please go vote for Certes' proposal at meta:Community Wishlist Survey 2021/Wikidata/Link Wikipedia redirects to Wikidata items.

Those community norms don't get created by creating a new endpoint page. We have a policy for creating property proposals and we need a similar policy for adding WDQS endpoints. To write a good policy one, we need knowledge about the costs about WDQS endpoints. The policy page on adding WDQS endpoints likely should explain that. After a policy is written it should be approved via RFC. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 16:34, 9 December 2020 (UTC) From the Wikidata:SPARQL federation input page the rules were: The suggested SPARQL endpoints must satisfy the following conditions: Complies with the SPARQL 1.1 protocol, \"query operation\" part, at least to the extent necessary to make federated SERVICE clause work (most SPARQL endpoints do). Contains data that can be linked to Wikidata - i.e., either contains Wikidata IDs or can be queried by values contained in one of the Wikidata properties. Has data freely available under license compatible with CC0 (preferred) or other free database license allowing unrestricted reuse. Attribution licenses like CC-BY are ok too. Currently, we do not accept endpoints with reuse restriction clauses like NC/ND. For the rule #3 it is proposed that if Wikimedia Commons accepts the license then it would be ok. Least CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, and ODbL are used in currently allowed endpoints. Technically cost of adding on outside of the community discussion is creating the phabricator ticket phab:T200066 and updating the whitelist. There may be also technical limitations why Wikimedia tech wants to deny or postpone adding new endpoints but reviewing that is outside of the community discussion scope and this selection happens after community approval. In any case is there some reason why these rules aren't enough for RfC and if not what we need more? --Zache (talk) 19:24, 9 December 2020 (UTC) Why can't I find lexemes in the statement value search box?

Nor does it come up searching the other way round (trying to add a \"part of\" statement to Lexeme:L348027.It looks to me like the search function in the statement interface isn't searching the lexeme namespace--is there a way around this? --Chapka (talk) 15:40, 9 December 2020 (UTC) @Chapka: the value of has part(s) (P527) may only be items and this property is not for lexemes. combines lexemes (P5238) is the correct property to use in lexeme. Note there are no inverse property as a word (or affix) may be found in hundreds of phrases.--GZWDer (talk) 16:52, 9 December 2020 (UTC) Dates related to appointments Hello, there. We have the appointed by (P748) property, but not an \"appointed on\" leaving some ambiguity as to what start time (P580) is referring to. Take Kirsten Gillibrand (Q22222) for instance who was appointed on January 23, 2009 but the appointment \"took effect\" on January 26, 2009 and she took the oath of office on January 27, 2009. [1]. Or Rebecca Latimer Felton (Q271243), who was appointed on October 3, 1922 but took the oath of office on November 21, 1922. [2]. There are other cases such as Tom Stewart (Q2440140) who was elected on November 8, 1938 but did not take the seat until January 16, 1939. [3]. The same for Huey Long (Q314384). Is it worth having separate properties for \"appointed on\" and \"sworn in on\" and maybe even \"elected on\" to distinguish from \"start time\" (which I take it should mean \"assumed the duties on\" when used with position held (P39))? I had the same question about popes, we have the start date for some as their election and some the start date as their consecration. --RAN (talk) 00:28, 10 December 2020 (UTC) I'd assume that start time (P580) is supposed to be the date where an appointment takes effect. This also affects awards, where an award winner may be announced at one time, and the award handed out at a ceremony some time later. But that won't stop the \"wrong\" value being used in a lot of cases. E.g., the British New Year honours, where the date of \"investiture\" may not be readily available. Ghouston (talk) 02:21, 10 December 2020 (UTC) I'd suggest using announcement date (P6949) for the other date. Ghouston (talk) 02:23, 10 December 2020 (UTC) For awards (which is all a bit off topic), it could also be argued that the presentation is a mere formality, and the date of the award is when it's announced. I'm also puzzled by a couple of Victoria Cross plaques, such as c:File:John_Whittle_memorial_Cygnet_20201114-012.jpg, where the date 9-15th April 1917 refers to the heroic deed itself, not the subsequent date when the award was approved, nor the subsequent investiture.

However, if I add the most important data in this manner, which is Q799299, I get an exclamation mark indicating:Values of significant event statements should be instances or subclasses of one of the following classes (or of one of their subclasses), but Indonesian killings of 1965–1966 currently isn't: occurrence

   event It seems as if one of the above, probably event or temporal entity (happened during a period of 2 years), could be added to Q799299.

ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 01:17, 11 December 2020 (UTC) Cleaning up old model for US Senate data As suggested here by @MisterSynergy:, I plan on removing position held (P39) United States senator (Q4416090) which do not supply a term. The only information contained in such statements not contained in those which do supply a parliamentary term (P2937) was spotty and occasionally inaccurate. The statements which do supply a parliamentary term (P2937) contain the complete historical record (excluding the results of the most recent election). Still to do is to supply elected in (P2715) but that is pending an organization of election in the United States (Q279283) which should distinguish between scheduled general elections and unscheduled elections in a rational way and perhaps have a clear model to indicate midterm elections. I'll probably do this work at the end of next week if there are no objections. Regards, Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 03:21, 29 November 2020 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: @Oravrattas: @Andrew Gray: So you want to delete the information about the current senators? Can you provide us with a sample edit? How do you make sure that other data is complete? As this provides us with a way of querying the current composition of the senate (e.g. position holder with a start date, but no end date), I don't think it's a good idea to delete these statements before you fixed the other statements (deleting fictive dates, as previously mentioned). To sum it up: No data should be deleted before we can check the same information is available otherwise. --- Jura 05:29, 29 November 2020 (UTC) current members. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 10:45, 29 November 2020 (UTC) @Gettinwikiwidit: Looks good, but I have also been wondering about end dates. Sitting senators in the current term all have their end dates set to 3 January 2021 (except two no-P582, oddly), and presumably once we index the next term, they would get 2021-23 dates. However, there's a widespread convention to indicate positions which are currently held by setting start time (P580) but not end time (P582) qualifiers, even if a future end date can be predicted with some confidence. A lot of queries use this as shorthand (\"presence of a P582 = not current\") in much the same way that a birthdate but no deathdate is used to infer \"person is alive\". So I'd agree with dropping P582 qualifiers on the current members, which will make a traditional-assumptions query like this one predictably return sitting members with new-style data. (If we do have a need to use predicted end dates, we can pick that up easily enough by querying the end date of the term itself.) Otherwise, definitely happy to remove all the \"old-style\" single statements. And then I think we'll have a pretty much consistent dataset, give or take a bit of error correction - congratulations! Andrew Gray (talk) 14:36, 29 November 2020 (UTC) @Andrew Gray: I'm agnostic about end time (P582)s. I think it's always up to the person generating the query to be careful in interpreting the data since anyone can edit the data set. When the full data set was generated they all had an end time (P582). When I first started looking at the data in the old model it was also inconsistent and I had to figure out how to deal with future end dates. Deleting them now just means they will need to be added again in a couple of months. If someone leaves early the end time (P582) will have to be edited either way. As long as the future date can reasonably be assured I think supplying it is a defensible position. I think leaving them out is also defensible. Further, I don't own this data. I'm not sure who's job it will be to add the end date in the future. That person is free to remove them now to make work for themselves in the future. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 21:56, 29 November 2020 (UTC) It is yet more making it up as you go along, Gwwi. There are not distinct districts. 'end date' != 'anticipated end date'. Your caveat reporter point is absolutely the case if the content of statements bears little resemblance to the plain intent of the properties. --Tagishsimon (talk) 22:17, 29 November 2020 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: It's not clear what value is added by turning this into a trading of insults. It's a fact that this is a volunteer effort. With that comes realities that need to dealt with. From a process stand point it's not clear that future dates will ever be added. Having them there when they're reasonably predictable means it's more likely to *remain* accurate in the future. My guess is that people jumping on all the \"popular pages\" will hand edit them to keep them up-to-date but the rest will be left to rot. No future dates are ever realized. If it were really a problem they could simply make it impossible to supply them. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 22:27, 29 November 2020 (UTC) Not for nothing, but harassing people contributing data makes it even less likely that they'll put in the effort to maintain it which further makes the case for having them there. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 22:32, 29 November 2020 (UTC) @Gettinwikiwidit: Personally, I would say the benefits of consistency here probably outweigh the minor hassle of having to update it in a few weeks (especially since we'll have do do a batch of edits then anyway to get all the new members in place, so closing off the older ones isn't much extra work). I'm happy to put a note in the calendar and take responsibility for sorting that out in January. Andrew Gray (talk) 23:05, 29 November 2020 (UTC) @Andrew Gray: From a process standpoint this seems like unnecessary busy work for the reasons outlined above, but as I say, I'm agnostic on the topic. Feel free to remove them now and add them back in later. In any event this has no bearing on the topic at hand of removing the old, inconsistent and occasionally inaccurate claims. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 23:32, 29 November 2020 (UTC) Sure - I'll run this tomorrow if it won't cause any problems for you. (didn't want to blunder in and do it if it would complicate the ongoing work!) No objection to removing the older data, as noted. Andrew Gray (talk) 23:35, 29 November 2020 (UTC) As suggested, I've now removed the end time (P582) values for sitting Senators which were set as 3 January 2021. This query confirms a simple question for \"Senators with a known start time but no P582\" returns 100 distinct people as expected - most are matching both the new and old statements, but it also works with only the new-style ones using parliamentary term (P2937). Andrew Gray (talk) 19:39, 30 November 2020 (UTC) Thanks for your cleanup, Andrew. I think we really need to be careful to avoid speculative end dates. Senators are not immortal nor should we include user's predictions. If one wants to check when a term ends, that should be on the item for the term itself. I noticed that finally deceased senator(s) are no longer marked as being \"in office\" at Wikidata either. As for the initial proposal, can we see a static list of claims to be deleted? Otherwise, once deleted, there is just no way of checking if what was done meets was proposed or agreed. --- Jura 17:43, 6 December 2020 (UTC) Broadly speaking it will be these claims, which are all on items that have a more comprehensive set of statements. I am doing some manual checks at the moment to ensure that where the old data has date qualifiers, they match up with the new data - this will take a few more days. It won't be deleted until that's sorted. Andrew Gray (talk) 00:28, 7 December 2020 (UTC) @Jura1: It's odd that you make the point that senators are not immortal since supplying and end date would seem to make exactly that case. In fact if no one maintains the data going forward you might be lead to believe that the senators term never ended. Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 02:00, 7 December 2020 (UTC) ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ Quick update: manual checks complete, and these are now ready to be deleted (list, 1896 statements). I've run a report comparing all of the existing statements with start/end dates against the new-style ones, manually fixing one or the other where necessary, and they are now all look safe to move. The only remaining discrepancies are down to an ambiguity over whether terms ended on 3 March or 4 March in the early years and these will be fixed up when that's standardised in a seperate round of edits. Andrew Gray (talk) 22:43, 8 December 2020 (UTC) Thanks very much. I'll delete the statements from this query tomorrow. Regards, Gettinwikiwidit (talk) 21:58, 9 December 2020 (UTC) This is done.

They do not have sitelinks. They are not notable in the sense that they can be described using serious and publicly available references (other, I suppose than each encyclopedia's index). They do not seem to fulfill a structural need - at least, one which could not be served by described at URL (P973) in the main subject's item.My view is that Wikidata is not made better by the accretion of crud; and that these items are cruddy. Should we be adding such items, or deleting them? – The preceding unsigned comment was added by Tagishsimon (talk • contribs). large imports should be approved.

Do you have plans to add essential missing structured data like published in (P1433) --> Benezit Dictionary of Artists (Q24255573) or useful descriptions like \"article in Benezit Dictionary of Artists\" (descriptions in any language would be an improvement from the ambiguous/no-context labels)? We've all seen your work before. -Animalparty (talk) 05:16, 10 December 2020 (UTC) I have brought this thread to GZWDer's attention. In general, it is preferable to raise issues like this directly with a user in the first instance. Unless we're going to get a lot more information on these items, it seems to me that this sort of import would be better embodied in an identifier property.

Bovlb (talk) 05:33, 10 December 2020 (UTC) \"connect the encyclopedia articles to the respective subject\" - this will be done soon. \"how these articles are notable\" - an article is itself a topic, which can be cited in Wikipedia article. Also, this allows using Wikidata search to find relevant potential topic. The data is in Mix'n'Match, but Wikidata provides more information (e.g. author). Furthermore, currently some of these article are described as scientific articles, which is not correct; import them will prevent errorous imports in the future. If there are further significant oppose I will stop this task.--GZWDer (talk) 07:11, 10 December 2020 (UTC) @GZWDer: I don't know enough about this import (e.g. where it's coming from, what further edits you will make, etc) to know if I would object. That's the point of seeking approval first. Yes, the approval process is kinda broken now (I waited over a month for my last BOT approval) but just breaking the rules because others are or its annoying isn't helpful. BrokenSegue (talk) 16:25, 10 December 2020 (UTC) Many people import all sorts of things without discussion, sometimes causing controversies.

BrokenSegue (talk) 20:46, 10 December 2020 (UTC) @GZWDer: Good practices for imports (which you mention below) include: making them as complete as possible in the first attempt, so that humans and machines alike can efficiently identify, contextualize, and build upon them. SourceMD does an admirable job of scraping all essential bibliographic properties (most of the time) from a simple DOI. Your LargeDatasetBot is also often very good at being complete enough. What is less helpful is when thousands of incomplete items are generated that fail to import essential properties like source for the Benezit articles, or birth/death dates for Geni.com and genealogics.org imports, or descriptions in any language. -Animalparty (talk) 20:23, 10 December 2020 (UTC) @GZWDer: A better question of how these articles are notable, would be how the bot approval justifies their import. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 13:24, 10 December 2020 (UTC) Actually, many things are imported to Wikidata without any discussion at all. This is not very bad (many imports are valid), but not optimal either.

Currently the resolution process is defective and may be stalled easily.--GZWDer (talk) 14:15, 10 December 2020 (UTC) I agree a document explaining \"good practices for imports\" would be nice to have.

I worked, amongst other items, on counter-insurgency and would like to have a brief confirmation on what I did, just to be sure. I translate the Wikidata terms into everyday language to test if my understanding is right:I added items to \"subclass of\" which are related to the subject in a manner such as \"counter-insurgency can be abstractly described as:\" a military strategy; a political strategy; etc.I added items to \"instance of\" which are related to the statement \"counter-insurgency can be/is\": warfare; political repression; human rights violation; etc.Coming to a specific question: \"property of\" would then imho be used for \"who does/practices counter-insurgency\", leading to items like: military; intelligence agency; special forces; counterinsurgency unit; etc.I would appreciate a brief assessment, especially on my last question just above. Pittigrilli (talk) 16:17, 11 December 2020 (UTC) I think typically \"instance of\" is reserved for statements which are more definitive. Counter-insurgency can be a human rights violation but it is not definitionally. You have the same issue with some of your subclasses. \"counter-insurgency\" isn't a kind of \"military intelligence\" (they are just related concepts). I think political strategy is arguable. \"who does/practices counter-insurgency\" is more for practiced by (P3095) not what you are saying. I made some edits to what I think is more appropriate. BrokenSegue (talk) 18:09, 11 December 2020 (UTC) Neither \"subclass of\" nor \"instance of\" are for adding all related terms. Tagging an item both covert operation (Q1546073) and black operation (Q3394581) is wrong. All black operation (Q3394581) are covert operation (Q1546073) and thus you don't add additional information to an item that's already tagged as black operation (Q3394581) by adding covert operation (Q1546073). There might be items that are both human rights violation (Q11376059) and counter-insurgency (Q760037) but given that not all counter-insurgency (Q760037) necessarily are human rights violation (Q11376059) it doesn't belong there. Items inherit all the subclasses of those classes that they reference via subclass of (P279). When it comes to improving the quality of the items black operation (Q3394581) are covert operation (Q1546073) a key question given that covert operation (Q1546073) is more narrow is: What is true for all black operation (Q3394581) but not true for all covert operation (Q1546073). The description should answer that question so users know when to use black operation (Q3394581) and when to use covert operation (Q1546073). Wikidata is a lot about thinking how individual items relate to each other and not so much about focusing on one item like you would focus on one Wikipedia article that you want to bring to featured status. In cases where a term as it's commonly used can mean multiple different things, the solution isn't to add different things into the same item but to create multiple items for the distinct meanings. Currently, counter-insurgency aircraft (Q5176890) has use (P366) counter-insurgency (Q760037) is one way we say who uses counter insurgency. An item for \"counterinsurgency unit\" would use the same pattern. Items like \"counterinsurgency unit\" would usually be created for structural need. If we have an item about an individual counterinsurgency unit there we would need a instance of (P31). I hope I could make things a bit more clear. If you have additional questions I'm happy to address them. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 18:11, 11 December 2020 (UTC) And maybe \"counterinsurgency unit\" practiced by (P3095) counter-insurgency (Q760037) would be more appropriate then has use (P366).

Pittigrilli (talk) 19:43, 11 December 2020 (UTC) Archivio Storico Ricordi Archivio Storico Ricordi (Q3621644) is being used as a reference by a bot, but I have corrected about a dozen typographical errors where dates have numbers transposed. Should we stop using it as a source adding in redundant information since it is so error prone, I can spot egregious errors with Wikidata:Database reports/items with P569 greater than P570 and Wikidata:Database reports/unmarked supercentenarians. It may be adding in more subtle ones. See for example: Johann Wilhelm von Mirbach-Harff (Q94785517) and Gabriel Astruc (Q3093605) and Paul Joseph Guillaume Hillemacher (Q2060201) and Giuseppe Taddei (Q471393). I will have to figure out a search to find the ones I corrected previously and did not track at Wikidata:WikiProject Authority control/Archivio Storico Ricordi errors. If we had a contact there, we could send them the errors to correct, like we used to be able to do at VIAF and LCCN. --RAN (talk) 18:18, 11 December 2020 (UTC) Green Map icons I am assembling a mapping between the terms used in the Green Map icons and Wikidata items. There may be 1-to-many mappings in some cases as some of the Green Map icons can represent quite general or multiple concepts. I am thinking to use described by source (P1343), where the source item would be Green Map Icons (Q103892210) and the reference URL (P854) would be the icon links found here. Ideally the icons would be uploaded as a collection to Commons but the license is not compatible. Does this sound like a suitable approach? Any alternative methods that could work better? Thanks!

ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 15:00, 12 December 2020 (UTC) Which Wikiprojects is responsible for GeoNames (Q830106) issues We frequently have people that notice issues involving Ceb-Wiki and GeoNames (Q830106) sourced items. I think it would be great to have a page giving guidance for those issues and likely it could be located at a Wikiproject. Which is the best Wikiproject for it? ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 12:35, 10 December 2020 (UTC) In my opinion the largest issue is 1. many pages in cebwiki are not linked to items and some people oppose further mass import for future duplicates; 2. Not many people care the unconnected pages in cebwiki; 3. People continue to import (eventual) duplicate from different source, and since Wikidata does not search unconnected pages, the number of duplicates will be higher and higher. If there is my choice, I will mass import all unconnected articles from cebwiki then discuss the next step. I don't like the current situation.--GZWDer (talk) 19:46, 10 December 2020 (UTC) I think most people prefer not important more cebwiki articles. If the unconnected cebwiki articles are ignored that's great. The problem is with those that are connected to Wikidata. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 21:21, 10 December 2020 (UTC) \"Ignored\" does make more duplicates - Wikidata exists as a place that problems may be found and fixed. What I hope in long term is once Abstract Wikipedia is a thing most cebwiki articles will be migrated to that.--GZWDer (talk) 23:33, 10 December 2020 (UTC) Do not mass-import cebwiki articles. >90 % of unconnected Cebwiki articles are duplicates or spurious. The data quality is atrocious. Existing entities in Wikidata that were created before someone had mercy and stopped these imports accounted for weeks of subjectively useless busywork I had to do this summer when I was trying to use Wikidata for actual work. That discussion you mention needs to happen before any import. If you feel any content on cebwiki represents actually existing entities, you're free to link them up with a reputable source. --Matthias Winkelmann (talk) 15:15, 11 December 2020 (UTC) Many of data from Geonames actually comes from one of these: GNIS Feature ID (P590) or GNS Unique Feature ID (P2326).--GZWDer (talk) 18:27, 11 December 2020 (UTC) That still leaves hundred thousand or millions of items that don't come from those. Important data from GNIS Feature ID (P590) which is public domain would be much better to import it from GeoNames which isn't.ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 15:06, 12 December 2020 (UTC) An awful situation where all the vague GeoName entries were imported, that we purposefully ignored. Many are synonyms for existing entries where there is not enough information to be either useful on their own, or have enough info to merge into the existing entry. At one time we debated importing all the VIAF entries, and we did not because of the very same reason, most that we do not have already are poorly defined and will never have enough information to be able to disambiguate properly or merge. If we reargue VIAF entries only import ones with a defined birth or death date, or both, so we avoid what happened at GeoNames. --RAN (talk) 00:05, 11 December 2020 (UTC) At very least, they have a valid sitelink, so they fall within WD:N. However, it will be useful to document what problems Geonames have (e.g. where does data come from; are there always a primary source for information; etc.) For VIAF, I think we should create a secondary Wikibase instance that VIAF data may be imported to.--GZWDer (talk) 00:14, 11 December 2020 (UTC) They might be notable but that doesn't mean that a bot job that adds a lot of doublicate items is reasonable. Anybody who wants to add items from CebWiki can do so if they check not to add doublicates.

 Try it! Two things can be observed: Most phones are an instance of product model (Q10929058) but more than 400 are instances of one of the following items: mobile phone form factor (Q2636061) system (Q58778) cell phone model (Q19723444) mobile phone series (Q20488450) electronic device model (Q62008942) (removed) model series (Q811701) (removed) electronic machine (Q2858615) (removed) brand (Q431289) Wikimedia disambiguation page (Q4167410) (this can be omitted as it is a valid property) What would be the correct value for instance of (P31)? I suppose product model (Q10929058) since it is in most of the phones but I don't know if there is a consensus about it. Isn't inception (P571) and publication date (P577) somewhat redundant? Using the GSMArena phone ID (P4723) as a reference, I would think that the inception (P571) corresponds to the moment the phone was announced and publication date (P577) would be when it was released for sale, but from what I've been seeing it seems that both properties are used indistinctly to indicate the date when the phone became available to the public.--Swicher (talk) 01:55, 1 December 2020 (UTC) Personally, I'd go with product model (Q10929058) for a single model and model series (Q811701) for a family or models (which will have subclasses which are product model (Q10929058).) For the dates, I think the most relevant are announcement date (P6949) and date of commercialization (P5204), since hardware isn't really \"published\" and inception (P571) presumably predates any public announcement, but is typically unknown. Ghouston (talk) 04:40, 1 December 2020 (UTC) Being both a Wikimedia disambiguation page (Q4167410) and another page is generally not valid. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 12:38, 1 December 2020 (UTC) A case like this needs thinking about how mobile phones be modeled and that model written down in a Wikiproject where it can be discussed and referenced in the future. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 12:38, 1 December 2020 (UTC) The following answer goes to both Ghouston and ChristianKl but it is easier for me to make a single message instead of two separate ones for each one. It seems to me that product model (Q10929058) is quite generic compared to more descriptive such as cell phone model (Q19723444) and smartphone model (Q19723451). In the case of Samsung Galaxy A51 (Q84849860) it has all three values together but I don't know if it should be kept like this or delete everything and leave only smartphone model (Q19723451) as the value of instance of (P31). One way these properties could be structured would be the following: Basic cellphone/feature phone/dumbphone Smartphone Unknown instance of (P31) cell phone model (Q19723444) smartphone model (Q19723451) cell phone model (Q19723444) subclass of (P279) feature phone (Q965424) smartphone (Q22645) mobile phone (Q17517) The unknown column would cover the phones that are not well known what type they are (for example, when importing data) and the value product model (Q10929058) could be kept or removed/depreciated. Other details that I noticed were the following: There are some phones that are instances of Android One (Q18063397) (see a list in Special:WhatLinksHere/Q18063397) but I think that it should be moved to a more appropriate property (class (P2308) or family (P53) perhaps?). Later I will start to change model series (Q811701) to mobile phone series (Q20488450) in some items since this value is more descriptive. I will do it manually since there seems to be normal phones mixed with the models. Done With respect to the following items I have my doubts as to whether the subclass is correct but I'm not sure what to replace it with: clamshell design (Q1532758) DIGNO (Q11195846) Cocoa Touch (Q2628895) Personal Handy-phone System (Q1718639) Regarding dates, I agree with Ghouston's idea, but with QuickStatements can you change inception (P571) to announcement date (P6949) and publication date (P577) to date of commercialization (P5204) in all items automatically? Because according to what I was seeing, this tool seems to only can be used to add or remove properties but not to \"rename\" them keeping the original values. About how the phone data should be modeled, the wikiprojects that could perhaps cover this would be Electronic Components and Informatics but I don't think that cell phones are its scope. I also updated the query to include smartphone (Q22645) and feature phone (Q965424) and a few days ago I was doing some cleaning on some items.--Swicher (talk) 13:38, 6 December 2020 (UTC) I updated the query to include some additional elements and a few days ago I also changed model series (Q811701) to mobile phone series (Q20488450) (or smartphone model series (Q71266741)). Regarding instance of (P31) and subclass of (P279) I am not going to make major modifications since there is no clear consensus on how this should be handled, the only thing I found on this subject was the following discussions: This talk in iPhone item Wikidata:Project chat/Archive/2019/09#Should iPhone 5s, model A1533 (Q66816688) be linked to smartphone (Q22645) via subclass of (P279) or instance of (P31) Wikidata:Project chat/Archive/2020/05#Android smartphone model --Swicher (talk) 13:19, 13 December 2020 (UTC) Recon service is down.

Can you help on this situation? Uncitoyen (talk) 16:18, 11 December 2020 (UTC) I do know that Germany would be an example where the head of government is also member of the cabinet. The term \"prime minister\" would, in itself, indicidate that these are similar. Turkey, of course, still has a prime minister as well as a president, IIRC, and it would make sense if only the former is a member of the cabinet. An English-language source would probably help in sorting this out. Although we strife to be language-agnostic, it is, unfortunately, difficult. As it currently stands, the claim remains and it's only the reference that was deleted? Let's loop E4024 in here to maybe shed some light. --Matthias Winkelmann (talk) 17:53, 13 December 2020 (UTC) The president is not part of any cabinet and I have not seen any reference that says what this user claims.

In this case, I'd recommend only using the more precise qualifier and dropping the more vague one, since it's mostly redundant. For the second, you could perhaps use applies to part (P518) on the reference? It's not very frequently used on references, though there are a thousand or so examples. I am sure I remember seeing a property proposal for some kind of \"reference applies to specific qualifier(s)\" property a year or so back, but I have completely failed to track down what happened to it.

Jheald (talk) 17:20, 8 December 2020 (UTC) @Jheald: That's the exact one, though for some reason I thought you were the original proposer :-). It looks like the proposal mostly failed on a \"not quite clear what's being suggested\" basis, so I wonder if it's worth resurrecting it with some more detailed practical examples (this one would be a good one, in fact - different sources for start, end, etc). The item as currently shown has an end date of both 1957 and 1958, which points out the other problem with qualifiers - we can't chain qualifiers onto other qualifiers, so there's no way to eg say \"circa\" but only have it apply to end time, not start time. Andrew Gray (talk) 21:55, 8 December 2020 (UTC) Maybe with earliest end date (P8554) and latest date (P1326)? Ghouston (talk) 03:04, 9 December 2020 (UTC) Been looking into this a bit more and there seem to be more cases of this than I thought - I make it 1813 items which have a \"spouse\" claim with two start dates, 1552 of which have both dates in the same year, and 1062 of which have the second year be \"year\" precision. (Edit: another 47 which have the second date at month precision, and both dates in the same month.) I think we could probably have a bot remove all those last thousand qualifiers (two claims, same year, one claim is year-precision only). Interestingly \"spouse\" seems to be a particular problem for this - the same query on P39 claims only finds 127 examples.

But it seems that there is a problem as they just can´t be merged. I am not very familiar with merging and the indications didn´t help me here. Maybe someone more experienced here could fix this problem, that would be wonderful! Thank you very much! Best wishes,--Joehawkins (talk) 16:55, 15 December 2020 (UTC) One is a former civil parish; the other a locality within the parish. They are distinct things, one nested within the other. They should not be merged. --Tagishsimon (talk) 16:59, 15 December 2020 (UTC) Question from a new contributor Hey, I'm fairly new to Wikidata. I've contributed pretty heavily to Wikipedia, moderately to Wiktionary, Wikispecies, and Wikivoyage, and a little bit to most of the other wikis.I recently edited the entry for Q4917275 (Biscuits and gravy), and in addition to adding a Commons category I recently created for the subject, I also noticed there was no Wiktionary entry listed on its WD page. I tried to link the corresponding article from the English Wiktionary, but an error message came up saying something about interlanguage links.I couldn't make heads or tails of it, so I clicked on WD:N in the message, and the policy reads: \"On Wiktionary, items for citation pages are not allowed. Main namespace is also excluded because interlanguage links are automatically provided by Cognate.\" I went to a Wikidata page for a random noun (Q33487 (homophobia)) just to see if it had any Wiktionary links, and there weren't any there either. Can anyone help me make sense of this in a familiar-with-Wikimedia-but-not-with-Wikidata-specifically way?Also, upon trying to publish the edit again to get the error message to paste here, the edit went through, since I guess Wikidata remembered that I'd seen the message. I can revert it if need be. TheTechnician27 (talk) 00:11, 16 December 2020 (UTC) @TheTechnician27: Interwiki links between Wiktionary mainspace pages are handled by the Cognate extension, and adding a Wiktionary sitelink to an item here removes all sitelinks which the extension would otherwise have provided (consider a given word with definitions in multiple Wiktionaries). Also, even absent the extension, adding Wiktionary mainspace links to Wikidata items is not appropriate because such links potentially describe multiple lexemes in multiple languages (the page \"mesa\", for example, describes a landform in English, a table in Spanish, and so many other things). It is thus better in each case to revert your addition of the Wiktionary sitelinks. Mahir256 (talk) 00:21, 16 December 2020 (UTC) Wikidata:Wiktionary/Sitelinks explains the current situation in regards to Wiktionary sitelinks in detail \"The links to pages of the main namespace should not be stored in Wikidata. A link to a Wiktionary entry should not be linked on a Q-item on Wikidata, since Q-items are about concepts and not words. Therefore, the section \"Wiktionary\" on items pages should not contain links to a Wiktionary entry. \" ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 01:46, 16 December 2020 (UTC) Obalky knih.cz Currently we have \"described by source=Obalky knih.cz\" for over 5,000 items, shouldn't this be made into an identifier instead? --RAN (talk) 22:00, 15 December 2020 (UTC) It should. It makes about as much sense as described by Discogs (Q504063) or Virtual International Authority File (Q54919). However, described by source (P1343) is rather open-ended, rather prone to duplication with encyclopedic identifiers, (e.g. American National Biography ID (P4823)), and likely to attract as many sources as devoted users are willing to add. As is often the case on Wikidata, there are no rules, only endless, fruitless discussions, so people will just do whatever until someone disagrees. And in the absence of guidance, it's quite easy for someone to use a bot or script to make thousands of questionable decisions in a single swoop. -Animalparty (talk) 20:53, 16 December 2020 (UTC) I will make it into a formal property proposal this weekend. Thanks for your input. --RAN (talk) 00:42, 17 December 2020 (UTC) How to retreive data from external website geonames.org Hello everybody, I realized that currently there're over 36.000 Italian human settlements in wikidata without located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) property but, at the same time, connected with the external website geonames.org which owns this information as 3rd level administrative entity. e.g. Q1942504 Is there any chance to import from this website data to wikidata?
