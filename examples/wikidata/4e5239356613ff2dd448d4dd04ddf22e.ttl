My problem is that the field for taxon name is a string rather than a Q number. Sorry if this is really obvious, but I just can't seems to work out if this can be done. Many thanks JerryL2017 (talk) 14:37, 1 November 2019 (UTC) @JerryL2017: I think something along the lines of the below might work. (It has dummy values in it right now, so produces 0 rows.) Can you supply an example particular parent taxon (P171) and an example pre-defined taxon name (P225) which we can use in the query instead of Q123456 and \"foo\" and we'll see if it does the trick, and if not, move to fix whatever's wrong.

Apologies for the missed fullstop :) --Tagishsimon (talk) 11:57, 2 November 2019 (UTC) Of course @Tagishsimon:, I want to refine my query now, by limiting the output to just one row per species, currently I get multiple rows back as some species have more than one taxon author (P405). Preferred option would be to concatenate the names into a single field, but if that's too tricky then just picking the first one would also work. I've had a go, but keep getting aggregations errors. Further advice would be gratefully received. This is my current query: SELECT ?parent_taxonLabel ?taxon_name  ?item  ?year_described  ?taxon_author ?taxon_authorLabel  ?nomencaturalstatus ?nomencaturalstatusLabel ?inaturalist_ID  WHERE {

 Try it! JerryL2017 (talk) 17:52, 2 November 2019 (UTC) @JerryL2017: Along these lines, then. This aggregation deals only with duplicates arising out of a plurality of author values ... if other properties have more than one value then they may cause dupes. As a rule, any variable in the select which is not wrapped in (group_concat(?x) as ?y) or similar must appear in the GROUP BY. So if others cause problems, follow the pattern & you're good.

 Try it! You need to use ?typeLabel instead of ?type in the GROUP_CONCAT, and also inform the label service which variables are associated with one another, because it can’t auto-detect the combination in this case; and because specifying ?type rdfs:label ?typeLabel also disables all other auto-detection of the label service, ?itemLabel and ?itemDescription need to be wired up as well. --TweetsFactsAndQueries (talk) 10:43, 4 November 2019 (UTC) Thanks a lot @TweetsFactsAndQueries: ! --2le2im-bdc (talk) 20:24, 4 November 2019 (UTC) @TweetsFactsAndQueries: Why does specifying ?type rdfs:label ?typeLabel disable all other auto-detection of the label service?

Being able to query for a known subject will be better. However I am reluctant to add a property like e.g. \"Name\" to this page to have a \"proxy\" This feels like doing the wrong thing for the right reason. Filtering on the name will be better however I do not know how to add this via the query helper. As soon as I do that I get \"depends on software\" which is not at all what I want to see. If I add name I get \"instance of name\" which is utterly wrong too. Another thing that puzzles me here is that is only shows the preferred version added.

Steak (talk) 11:58, 7 November 2019 (UTC) Well, working with this vast number of P1087 statements is always challenging. The strategy should always be to limit the data to be processed as early as possible, and so-called \"named subqueries\" as shown above are a really handy method to do so. Here, you can run the subquery separately, and see that it takes already a reasonable amount of the one minute timeout timeframe (it even times out occasionally). However, the result of the subquery is a rather slim data set of only ~15k rows, with \"item---earliest elo date\" pairs. You then inject this results set into the main query with INCLUDE, and subsequently you just consider the ~15k items only which is not expensive at all. If you want to, you could try to add (some) more conditions to the main query part, as it should not bloat execution times significantly. —MisterSynergy (talk) 12:08, 7 November 2019 (UTC) Count and list specific items Beginners question: How can I count how many objects are stored in WD?

 Try it! Now a few further questions come up. Unfortunately, my Swiss school English is pretty poor, WD technically I am a beginner and also in DB design and programming in general I only know basics.The aim of my work is to build a port layer at https://map.openseamap.org that shows all ports worldwide, and where you can get more information about by a clickable icon (Wikipedia, Commons, Wikidata, Weather, etc). Displaying and linking is under our control. The point here is to develop the DB behind it. This will integrate several platforms and port data sources across projects. Master: World Port Index (WPI, mdb-file) Further sources: WD, OSM, Port Wiki, ... In a first step we would like to merge WPI and WD...Is it ok for you, to ask in German, translated with DeepL.com/Translator? Bests regards, --Markus (talk) 15:23, 9 November 2019 (UTC) @Markus Bärlocher: Any language or translation is fine; we'll work out a way. Your English is very good indeed :) --Tagishsimon (talk) 18:40, 9 November 2019 (UTC) Questions Ok thanks, let's start...I would like to understand the WD principe a little more. With my query in 8. I did find 4658 hits. But I suppose, that some of the objects have 2 or more attributes? so there are less real objects. First question: how many \"harbours\" we have in WD? And therefore: how does it work in WD to define objects? What is the difference between \"harbor\"=Q283202 and \"port\"=Q44782 ? How does WD defines, if an object is a harbor? or a port? What is the difference of \"inland port\"=Q863915 and \"inland harbor\"=Q6034850 ? Is \"inland port\"=Q863915 a subclass of \"port\"=Q44782 ? so if we take all \"ports\", we will have the \"inland ports\" too? Similar for \"inland harbor\" and \"harbor\"? What is the unique ID for a \"harbour\" tupel/tuple/Datensatz? Best regards, --Markus (talk) 00:12, 10 November 2019 (UTC) @Markus Bärlocher: Quite what users think each of the port/harbour items you identify mean, is probably a bit of a mystery. We could go by the en.wiki articles for each, in which distinctions are drawn between port & harbour and between inland port and inland harbour; but the probability is that if we did the same exercise by looking at another language's articles, we might come away with a different understanding. I expect, for the most-part, that port and harbour are used interchangably and - until someone comes along and starts to curate the port/harbour dataset - that situation will persist. With luck, you are the person who will curate ports & harbours. Thanks for your explanations. All in all - for me WD seems to be an a litte confused... May be it is a systemic problem? DB-design and data-definition by crowd sourcing? Big step from national data (WP) to an international DB (WD)? Personal/local driven people without organisational structure and without a defined preocess? Well motivated laypeople with limited knowledge in DB-design (like me) and with limited knowledge in relation to the content/topic (like me too)? Example: A place where ships can stay in water is called in German \"Hafen\". In en-English it is \"port\" and \"harbor\". In us-Englisch it is \"port\" and \"harbour\". But us-\"harbour\" and en-\"harbor\" is not the same, and both is different from \"port\". And everybody has his own interpretation of this words. All this results in a babylonic linguistic confusion ;-) No problem if you point with your finger to a port and say \"harbour\" - until you don't feed it in a DB ;-) WD distinguishes between \"port\" and \"harbor\" - but the description does not really help. And both is translated to German \"Hafen\" - but how to retranslate?. Crowd sourcing is maybe driven by \"personal meanings\", following personal use cases. Like in Wikipedia each country goes his own way - but WD needs to consolidate all this to an \"international\" DB. I have no idea how to make this in a better way... \"My\" use case is: adding valued content to the WPI-DB as a benefit for watersport enthusiasts. Therefore we need a merged table between WPI-DB and WD-content (Wikipedia, Commons, Wikitravel, ...). And this is a chance for WD too: maybe we can help togehter somehow to add contend to WD, and to structurize the data-system a little bit in a small part :-) So we need to identify every item that has a instance of (P31) value that is a subclass of port (Q44782) (and indeed harbor (Q283202) is a subclass of port, so by getting the port subclass we get the harbour subclass too). And then we need to deal with cases where an item has more than one P31 value. I've done that in the query below. If I understand your direction of travel, it would be ideal if port/harbour items had identifier properties such that they can be cross-checked with external sources. You have mentioned LOCODE and that seems to be a property - UN/LOCODE (P1937) - so maybe if you can identify port and harbour names and LOCODEs from an external source, and we can add P1937 values to existing harbour/port items, or create new items ... and validate our ports and harbours against an external source. Ditto for any other identifier numbers that might be attached to ports - either we have a property we can use; or if not, we can propose a new property be added. --Markus (talk) 14:44, 10 November 2019 (UTC) Maybe we can pretend UN/LOCODE (P1937) and UN/LOCODE (Q499348) are the same? Can you build a class/function \"Hafen\" which encorporates \"all such places\"? Which delivers only one real object (no duplicates) with same location and same name? I did add some properties in the table above. Does it help for you? What is the difference between UN/LOCODE (P1937) and UN/LOCODE (Q499348)? which one do we need? Unfortunately LOCODE disapeared from the WPI-DB (or was never there). So this is no more a hook for easy merging. Name, Coordinate and \"nearby\"-search, county code, seems to be the only hooks... --Markus (talk) 14:44, 10 November 2019 (UTC) # distinct port or harbour type items

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 00:54, 10 November 2019 (UTC) (this query I did not understand) Oh, and we should not forget there will be many items for harbour and ports which do not have a harbour/port type P31. We can go fishing for these if we have an external list against which to work. --Tagishsimon (talk) 00:59, 10 November 2019 (UTC) There's also OpenStreetMap relation ID (P402) and OpenStreetMap tag or key (P1282), which might provide a means of linking items with OpenSeaMap, given (I understand) that it is a subset of OpenStreetMap. --Tagishsimon (talk) 01:08, 10 November 2019 (UTC) Yes, OpenSeaMap is part/a subset of OSM, key is seamark:*. For \"Hafen\" we have: seamark:type=harbour and seamark:harbour:category=*. There is leisure=Marina and harbour=*. But the systematic is also poor like in WD. And there is no data about \"size\" (container, tons, passenger, etc). We need a kind of \"size\" (like L,M,S,V in WPI) for allocating the icons to different zoomlevels in the chart.

How to force a \"conversion\" for these month values ? https://w.wiki/Bjg Bouzinac (talk) 08:08, 9 November 2019 (UTC) @Bouzinac: You can do it by adding a second element that *only* finds months, and then converts them by hand.

SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }

   ?siège p:P2047/psv:P2047/wikibase:quantityUnit ?unit. 
   ?siège p:P2047/psn:P2047/wikibase:quantityAmount ?duréeNorm . # this section finds only periods which can be normalised - everything except months
 }
  union

   ?siège p:P2047/psv:P2047/wikibase:quantityUnit wd:Q5151. # force this bit to only do months
   bind((?dur_e*30*86400) as ?duréeNorm) } # normalised length = months * 30 * 86400
}
 Try it! It has the ?unit section in the second one to make sure the months all get ?unitLabel correctly - there is probably a neater way to do this though!
