From this Grafana plot it appears that wdqs1005 was taken out for a while yesterday, and then since it came back online it has been keeping up very well with updates. But that is leaving wdqs1004, 6 and 7 in the dust, as their lags have been growing steadily, now up to over 3 hours. Given the \"median\" maxlag approach and that wdqs1005 and the 3 200* servers are all fine, bot edits are unconstrained at the moment, so that lag will likely continue to grow. What can be done about this? ArthurPSmith (talk) 13:51, 23 March 2020 (UTC) somehow it stabilized and then started to improve (perhaps because the edit rate slowed down). But today, as of about 3 hours ago, wdqs1005 and wdqs1006 seem to have switched places: now wdqs1006 has very low lag, while 5 (and 4 and 7 still) is growing. Some fiddling with load balancers going on maybe? ArthurPSmith (talk) 18:29, 24 March 2020 (UTC) I'm keeping an eye on those servers. Repooling wdqs1006 seemed to have helped a bit, but not enough. We are working on a patch Tracked in Phabricator Task T249196 to disable the cleanup of values, which might help to improve the update performances (at the cost of some additional disk usage). --GLederrey (WMF) (talk) 12:05, 2 April 2020 (UTC) Federated query to the categories namespace Hi, Would it be possible to enable federated queries from WDQS's main namespace to the categories namespace endpoint https://query.wikidata.org/bigdata/namespace/categories/sparql? --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 19:12, 9 April 2020 (UTC) The categories endpoint is already white-listed from https://query.wikidata.org/, if you are experiencing issues could you paste the query that is not working as expected? DCausse (WMF) (talk) 14:32, 14 April 2020 (UTC) Thank you, DCausse (WMF). I never tried any query because the categories endpoint isn't on the list of available endpoints at mw:Wikidata Query Service/User Manual/SPARQL Federation endpoints. I will it try tomorrow. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 14:56, 14 April 2020 (UTC) It is definitely missing in this list, fixed, thanks for bringing this up. DCausse (WMF) (talk) 15:09, 14 April 2020 (UTC) I have now tried a federated query to the categories endpoint, and the federation works fine. But unfortunately I found out that data is missing in the categories namespace which are already treated at phab:T246568. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 21:29, 14 April 2020 (UTC) It would be nice having a simple way to get truthy statements in WDQSIt is often the case that you need more information about a statement than a simple value. That can be e.g. qualifiers, references, value precision, value unit or others things. In these cases you have to use the p: prefix instead of wdt: but you often still want to access only truthy statements. It is possible to add a test for truthyness, like this:"@en;
