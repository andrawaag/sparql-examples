It goes to this URL https://medlineplus.gov/mastectomy.html query A: Is it possible to write a query that produces a list WP articles that contain a reference where inURL there is string medlineplus.gov? (realted question, does WD import (like it does for all articles) also every reference ever used in WP? If that is hard, I need just a query B: list of all webcites in WP. references like these: <ref>{{cite web |url=I found this article that generated it but the dataset on figshare is no longer there and is also now outdated. https://medium.com/freely-sharing-the-sum-of-all-knowledge/what-are-the-ten-most-cited-sources-on-wikipedia-lets-ask-the-data-34071478785a EncycloABC (talk) 14:12, 27 September 2019 (UTC) I am also interested in this query, hopefully someone provides a solution. HandsomeBoy (talk) 16:24, 27 September 2019 (UTC) @EncycloABC, HandsomeBoy: This is not something that Wikidata Query Service can do. I doubt there is a corpus of all references present in English Wikipedia, so your best chance is to search all links to https://medlineplus.gov via en:Special:LinkSearch and somehow manually sort out those which are inside references. Maybe you could write a search RegEx but I don't have the skills for that.Vojtěch Dostál (talk) 06:37, 2 October 2019 (UTC) Thank you @Vojtěch Dostál:. HandsomeBoy (talk) 08:00, 2 October 2019 (UTC) Ordered tree of military grades Hello, for instance with colonel (Q104680), how to show the tree of grades general>colonel>lieutenant, etc? Perhaps with next lower rank (P3729) and next higher rank (P3730) but how ?Bouzinac (talk) 10:49, 2 October 2019 (UTC) Bouzinac: Could you elaborate more? Are you interested in the full tree for a given initial item, such as colonel (Q104680)? Do you want all levels, or only the immediate higher and lower tank? --MarioGom (talk) 12:26, 2 October 2019 (UTC) That's good point. Well, let's say I would tick colonel (Q104680) and get all the uppers and the lowers ranked grades, with colonel (Q104680) being somewhere in the middle of the tree ? something like that ? author TomT0m / talk page 14:49, 2 October 2019 (UTC) Oui, quelque chose dans ce goût-là mais Q11993019 semble aberrant et il semble aussi que la hiérarchie des grades est bien plus complexe : Je m'attendais à voir par exemple Q48755225 mais en fait la fiche wikidata est vide :'| Bouzinac (talk) 15:27, 2 October 2019 (UTC) Les données sont pas au niveau, encore, probablement. Je m’attends à un gros bazar et à des confusions, perso, vu qu’il doit y avoir des changements historiques et des grades de même noms qui sont dans des hiérarchies différentes … Faudrait que je ressorte les tentatives de visualisation des rangs tax(i·o)nomiques pour avoir une tentative de visualisation. author TomT0m / talk page 15:42, 2 October 2019 (UTC) Filtered descriptions To get the items which have description in English ( for eg \"human settlement in Malappuram district\" )but don't have descriptions in \"ml\" language.--Akbarali (talk) 14:01, 2 October 2019 (UTC) Petscan has filters to do that. But that query should do the trick for a sample of 1000. author TomT0m / talk page 15:54, 2 October 2019 (UTC) But in this qurey it shows different descriptions.--Akbarali (talk) 13:35, 3 October 2019 (UTC) @Akbarali: It’s the same query as far as I can see. Only a sample of 1000 is shown, there is too many to find all of them. It may occur that from one query call to another different samples are shown. author TomT0m / talk page 16:50, 3 October 2019 (UTC) Filter according to Wikipedia category Hi all!

And if yes, how would such a query look? if not, what's the best way to tackle this problem (clicking 2000 times is not really an option)? Antoni1626 (talk) 08:39, 7 October 2019 (UTC)This is the query for the municipalities with a start date set: SELECT ?municipalityLabel ?municipality ?begindatum ?einddatum ?CBS_gemeentecode WHERE {

Antoni1626 (talk) 08:55, 7 October 2019 (UTC) @Antoni1626: You can take the QIds from your second query, and use them in Quickstatements (help). In short you'll need to feed it a set of rows in the form -Q9769 [tab] P31 [tab] Q2039348. (Obvs, you need to be responsible for the goodness of your analysis...) --Tagishsimon (talk) 09:08, 7 October 2019 (UTC) @Antoni1626, Tagishsimon: QS seems to remove the first statement that fulfils the criteria that instance of (P31) equals municipality of the Netherlands (Q2039348) without taking any qualifiers into consideration. See my experiments in Wikidata Sandbox (Q4115189), both using exactly the same QS syntax from above: experiment 1 where QS removes only one of two statements without start time (P580) qualifier experiment 2 where QS removes the statement with start time (P580) qualifier while leaving the statement without start time (P580) The above \"QS syntax\" will thus only work as long as the statement without qualifier(s), the one you want to remove, is the first of the instance of (P31) statements and that there are just one statement without qualifier(s). In this particular case this may be fulfilled if all the faulty statements are \"older\" and the correct statements are \"newer\" and there is not more, or less, than one faulty statement per object, but in general you will have to check that these conditions before using QS to do such removal of statements. --Larske (talk) 09:38, 8 October 2019 (UTC) Good point; hadn't occurred to me. --Tagishsimon (talk) 10:21, 8 October 2019 (UTC) Reduce duplicates of Flanders Institute Arts Organization ID Hi guysCurrently, I am contributing for the following WikiProject Wikidata:WikiProject_Performing_arts/Data_structure/Data_modelling_issues. I identified some duplicates. There are multiple records with a Flanders Art Institute organization ID who refer to the same organization.I created a query to identify the number duplicates, but unfortunately, I am not able to make a list with the duplicates. The goal is to have a query, which could help to identify and tackle the duplicates.Former query: try itList should have at least the following attributes (with example records, see example): Flanders Art Institute organization ID ItemIdentifier_1 ItemLabel_1 ItemIdentifier_2 ItemLabel_2 361416 Q54804772 Q54804772 Q55829416 De Ontmoeting Thank you for your help. @Boxomi: Something similar; does this work for you?

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 19:20, 7 October 2019 (UTC) multiple optional conditions Hi! we currently try to request a query for a list of q-numbers. The q-number is replaced from time to time. Depending on the requested q-number the given values of orcid, employer(s) and gender are given (or not) in the data set of the item. Therefore, those values should somehow be indicated as \"optional\". SELECT  ?orcid ?employerLabel ?genderLabel ?parents ?parentsLabel
                        WHERE { 
                         OPTIONAL {?item wdt:P496 ?orcid }.  
                         OPTIONAL {?item wdt:P108 ?employer }. 
                         OPTIONAL {?item wdt:P21 ?gender }.

                        }
 Try it! Can someone please correct my syntax? Thank you! Eva @EvaSeidlmayer: It seem you have to include at least one non optional triple pattern to make the query work. As far as I can tell you’re interested into human items, so I added something related to the item being a human. SELECT ?orcid ?employerLabel ?genderLabel ?parents ?parentsLabel
WHERE { 
  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q5 .
  OPTIONAL {?item wdt:P496 ?orcid }.  
  OPTIONAL {?item wdt:P108 ?employer }. 
  OPTIONAL {?item wdt:P21 ?gender }.

  Values ?item { wd:Q28360163 }.

 }
 Try it! author TomT0m / talk page 11:40, 8 October 2019 (UTC) Oh, reading the sparql doc on optional it seems that « optional » must just have something on the left. After testing, the « values » clause can serve as this something and just inversing stuffs in your original query works : SELECT ?orcid ?employerLabel ?genderLabel ?parents ?parentsLabel WHERE {
  VALUES ?item {
    wd:Q28360163
  }
  OPTIONAL { ?item wdt:P496 ?orcid. }
  OPTIONAL { ?item wdt:P108 ?employer. }
  OPTIONAL { ?item wdt:P21 ?gender. }

For example, all letter \"h\" entries from pt.wikipedia.org? – The preceding unsigned comment was added by Rodvillar (talk • contribs).SELECT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE { ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q146.
 SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". } } @Rodvillar: if I understand correctly, this. ?item rdfs:label ?itemLabel is used to get the label of the item within the query, rather than relying on the wikibase:label service; this facilitates filtering on the label value within the query. In the example below, the English label is fetched; change the lang filter to your preferred label language. SELECT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE {
  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q146.
  ?item rdfs:label ?itemLabel . filter(lang(?itemLabel)=\"en\")
