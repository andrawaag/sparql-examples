 Try it! You cannot further process labels that were collected with the label service (as you want to do by group concatenation). rdfs:label and a subsequent lang filter is suitable for that purpose. —MisterSynergy (talk) 22:05, 27 April 2018 (UTC) MisterSynergy would it be possible to have a link to each property and as link label the propertyLabel? 77.179.61.171 21:40, 4 May 2018 (UTC) To my knowledge this is not possible in the Query Service GUI. You would have to query with a script, reshape the result to the desired format and output it e.g. by bot to a wikipage.

Each chapter or user groups that is present should colour that section of the map in (I realise this excludes the thematic organisations). This would basically be an animated map of the graph that appears in this page.I want this for two reasons: I'm running a Mozilla Sprint project to encourage people to add information to Wikidata about the open movement see here and would really like to use this as an example. I think a non timeline version could be used as a useful explorer for the Meta page on Chapters and User groups. If it could look like the maps on Wikidata:Wikidata_in_Wikimedia_projects#Maps_and_graphs that would be super amazing, e.g clicking on an area brought up website, contact info etc. To make sure the query is correct I guess there should be additional queries for number of chapters and usergroups, if a country or region is stated on their item etc. I'm very happy to do the legwork to fill in gaps.Thanks--John Cummings (talk) 15:00, 6 May 2018 (UTC) @John Cummings: Hm, I don’t think that’s possible as you describe it… as far as I’m aware we don’t directly support animated maps. A non-animated map with different layers for different years would in theory be possible, but in practice I don’t think we don’t have enough geoshape (P3896) statements on countries yet.

It will be hard to manually check what's wrong with those books. Many thanks again. --Wikidelo (talk) 13:37, 11 May 2018 (UTC) @Wikidelo: There may be nothing wrong. My books have been translated into languages I can't write - I'm still the author. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 04:14, 12 May 2018 (UTC) @Pigsonthewing: Of course, so the query excludes version, edition or translation (Q3331189). Now it also excludes, for example, works written in English (Q1860) by authors who speak British English (Q7979) or American English (Q7976) but it doesn't work viceversa, i.e.: it still shows works written in British English (Q7979) by authors who speak or write plain English (Q1860). I think this can be solved, but the main flaw of the query is in cases of books by two or more people, like The Aquariums of Pyongyang (Q492500), written in French (Q150), where Pierre Rigoulot (Q3386800) knows French (Q150) but Kang Chol-hwan (Q483097) does not, so the book appears in the list. I've not checked the 15000 results, but randomly looking at some of them I can tell there's a lot of people with languages spoken, written or signed (P1412) missing and, definitely, something wrong with a bunch of those books.

Meingbg (talk) 09:23, 17 May 2018 (UTC) Query for complex constraint: if property has value A then qualifier B should be present The problem is with safety classification and labelling (P4952) and its qualifiers. In many items it looks like safety classification and labelling (P4952)NFPA 704: Standard System for the Identification of the Hazards of Materials for Emergency Response (Q51139288) NFPA Health (P993) NFPA Fire (P994) NFPA Instability (P995) NFPA Special (P877) I every case if safety classification and labelling (P4952)NFPA 704: Standard System for the Identification of the Hazards of Materials for Emergency Response (Q51139288) the set of 4 qualifiers should be present (and in many items right now e.g. P877 is absent). So I'm trying to add a complex constraint (I was advised that it can't be done using normal constraints) for this. What I've tried I thought that if I add this constraint to P993/P994/P995/P877 and the constraint is like select all items where safety classification and labelling (P4952)NFPA 704: Standard System for the Identification of the Hazards of Materials for Emergency Response (Q51139288) and there is no qualifier Pxxx, the problem will be solved. I managed to write this (SPARQL is not my thing, I wrote this based on other queries): SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel
WHERE { ?item wdt:P4952 wd:Q51139288.
        ?item p:P4952 ?statement.
        FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?statement pq:P993 ?x }
       
        SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }
      }
LIMIT 2000
 Try it! But obviously this is not what I'm looking for, because it finds items where safety classification and labelling (P4952)Regulation (EC) No. 1272/2008 (Q2005334) has no P993... (and in this case there shouldn't be any P993 because other set of qualifiers should be here). In the worst scenario (rare but possible) there may be multiple safety classification and labelling (P4952)NFPA 704: Standard System for the Identification of the Hazards of Materials for Emergency Response (Q51139288) in one item, each with different values. E.g. in one item it may look like: safety classification and labelling (P4952)NFPA 704: Standard System for the Identification of the Hazards of Materials for Emergency Response (Q51139288) NFPA Health (P993) = 1 / NFPA Fire (P994) = 1 / NFPA Instability (P995) = 1 / NFPA Special (P877) = OX safety classification and labelling (P4952)NFPA 704: Standard System for the Identification of the Hazards of Materials for Emergency Response (Q51139288) NFPA Health (P993) = 1 / NFPA Fire (P994) absent / NFPA Instability (P995) = 2 / NFPA Special (P877) = OX safety classification and labelling (P4952)Regulation (EC) No. 1272/2008 (Q2005334) GHS hazard pictogram (P5040) = ... / GHS signal word (P1033) = ... / GHS hazard statement (P5041) = ... / GHS precautionary statement (P5042) = ... So I have two questions: is it possible to somehow get select all items with safety classification and labelling (P4952)NFPA 704: Standard System for the Identification of the Hazards of Materials for Emergency Response (Q51139288) , then look if Pxxx is present in each such statement (but without checking P4952 that has other value than Q51139288)? maybe there is simpler/better way to achieve this (by this I mean that: if there is safety classification and labelling (P4952)NFPA 704: Standard System for the Identification of the Hazards of Materials for Emergency Response (Q51139288) then all 4 qualifiers P993/P994/P995/P877 should be present). Wostr (talk) 20:44, 8 May 2018 (UTC) @Wostr:, I'm not sure where we're going with this. Your query example is only picking up P4952=Q51139288 and Q51139288 has no P993, so where you say \"this is not what I'm looking for, because it finds items where ,,statement||P4952|Q2005334,, has no P993\" does not, for me, compute. Slightly amending & expanding your query, below, currently allows us to find P4952=Q51139288 with any one of the four pqs missing, and you can play with different arrangements of filter not exist to see different combinations of missingness. The query below demands that a single instance of Q51139288 must have each of the 4 pqs ... it does not deal with a situation in which there are multiple P4952=Q51139288 statements, each having a single qualifier. Do we need to solve that. (Or do we need to find such cases, and knock some sense into them. Umm. Help me out. What direction do you want to go in? I'm not familiar with complex constraints ... maybe I should go read up on them. Read this. As far as I can see, the below will serve as a custom constraint for the condition P4952=Q51139288 and Q51139288 has any one of P877, P993, P994 or P995 missing.

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 22:47, 8 May 2018 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: the problem is that: P4952=Q51139288 should always have all 4 qualifiers (P993/P994/P995/P877) P4952=Q2005334 should always have all 4 qualifiers (P5040/P1033/P5041/P5042; but this is not the problem right now) The query is picking items where P4952=Q51139288 has no P993/P994/P995/P877 (this is correct) but also items where P4952=Q2005334 has no P993/P994/P995/P877 (this is not). There is e.g. ethanol (Q153) in the results, where v t e safety classification and labelling (P4952) NFPA 704: Standard System for the Identification of the Hazards of Materials for Emergency Response (Q51139288) edit NFPA Health (P993) 2 NFPA Fire (P994) 3 NFPA Instability (P995) 0 NFPA Special (P877) no value 0 references add reference Regulation (EC) No. 1272/2008 (Q2005334) edit GHS hazard pictogram (P5040) ... GHS signal word (P1033) ... GHS hazard statement (P5041) ... GHS precautionary statement (P5042) ... 0 references add reference add value So all 4 qualifiers for the first statements are present, but the query looked in the second statement and found no P993/P994/P995/P877 (and there shouldn't be any P993/P994/P995/P877, because it's the different statement). Wostr (talk) 07:07, 9 May 2018 (UTC) I think ethanol is being selected because of the P877=no value in Q51139288 - see, for instance, this section. I think Q2005334 is a red herring; nothing is being selected because of it. So talk to me about P877=no value. Is that valid, or do we treat P877=no value as being the same as an absent P877? If the latter, then the query is okay. If the former, we need to rejig the query to deal with the no value issue. Not yet sure how to do that, right now, but maybe ?statement a wdno:PQ877 is the direction of travel; the query below, for instance, finds items with a P877 of no value. Not yet sure how to wrangle that into useful filter, and right now I urgently need to go and murder a busker playing very loudly amplified accordian music with an easy listening backing tape.

Is there some way to create a map which shows which languages are present in which countries? I know there are some issues with lack of shape files for countries and country regions. But I've also seen maps like this? I'm very happy for it to work for a very small region, all I want to show is that its is possible and you can click a button to get to the Wikipedia article for that language. This could either be a map to show all the languages in a region or which countries a language is spoken in or both.Thanks very much--John Cummings (talk) 10:11, 15 May 2018 (UTC)Here's a query that can start to answer this question: a map showing every sovereign state and its official languages.

I am trying to create a SparQL query that will list all the articles that have on focus list of Wikimedia project (P5008) and Amnesty International Edit-a-thon (Q53764742), and also the specific qualifier location (P276) plus Amsterdam (Q727). I created the query I have placed underneath here, but it doesn't give any result(s). (At the moment it should at least produce Nada Kiswanson (Q53766816).) Ideally I would like to also include the qualifier point in time (P585) with value 19th of May 2018 (in combination with Amsterdam as a location), but I honestly have no idea how to format that date part of the query. #articles created during editathon

 Try it! The Le Figaro example is proposed here as \"A query that has difficulties\" for automatic optimization. The proposed solution appears to be turning the optimizer off, but my query still times out when the limit is removed. https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/query_optimizationSo i suppose my question is: Is there any way to get find all uses of \"http://statline.cbs.nl\" in the entire wikidata dataset without getting a timeout? – The preceding unsigned comment was added by LeviQueryRequest (talk • contribs) at 13:35, 23 May 2018‎ (UTC). This is not possible with the Query Service, but you can simply use Special:LinkSearch/statline.cbs.nl. —MisterSynergy (talk) 14:09, 23 May 2018 (UTC) Get all Lexeme lemmas and IDs With the Lexeme property officially launched, I wanted to do a simple query to return all the current lexeme IDs and their Lemma label. Here's an example of a lexeme. It's modeled similarly to wikidata properties, it seems, using a Lexeme namespace (Lexeme:L1). I tried to query all the lexemes in the same way one would query all the properties, which didn't seem to work. Does anyone know how to properly list all of them currently?
