  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q79007. # Innerortsstraße
  ?item wdt:P17 wd:Q183.   # Deutschland
  ?sitelink schema:about ?item .
  ?sitelink schema:isPartOf <https://commons.wikimedia.org/> .

  FILTER (!bound(?commonscat))   # nur jene OHNE commonscat-Property (P373)
}
 Try it! The query currently returns sometimes 22/23, sometimes 30 entries, depening when and how often the query is executed, allthough the objects have not been changed inbetween. Although the objects actually have a commonscat-Property, so they should not be listed at all in the result set, i.e. the result set actually should be empty.For just one city (e.g. ?item wdt:P131 wd:Q61724. ) the query returns 2, 3 or 4 entries if the query is repeatedly executed.Could this be a caching problem? Why are entries with commonscat-properties listed, while they should be filtered out? A purge to some objects did not change anything Using Cache Busting ( SELECT ?item ?commonscat ?sitelink (MD5(CONCAT(STR(?item), STR(RAND()))) as ?random) WHERE { ) does not change anything. Replag currently shows no problems.

I'm adding retries into my code for now but sometimes it still fails after 3 retries with random wait between the retries, causing the whole job to crash.Is there any known reason for this instability? --Kdutia (talk) 10:46, 3 November 2020 (UTC) Do you have more details on the nature of the errors and when they happened? Thanks! (note that this question might be better answered in Wikidata:Contact_the_development_team as it does not relate directly to the query service nor search). DCausse (WMF) (talk) 10:50, 4 November 2020 (UTC) Hello @Kdutia:, thanks for reporting this issue. Is it still happening these days? Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 13:57, 9 November 2020 (UTC) Hi @DCausse (WMF): @Lea Lacroix (WMDE): I haven't run the batch process in a while but will be running it today or tomorrow, so will let you know. I was getting an HTTP 500 error before. Thanks! --Kdutia (talk) 11:05, 10 November 2020 (UTC) Faster way to query sparql with labels Hi, I need to run SPARQL at wikidata endpoint using query that has a few labels in it, label query is very slow and inefficient, such as this, to find journalist that are born in Chicago it takes about 29 seconds, I have many other query that also time out.
