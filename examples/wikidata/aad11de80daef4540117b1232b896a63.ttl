This way you can for instance find the date of the first revision of one or more Wikipedia articles, but you cannot search for all articles written in 2011, or check the dates of all geocoded articles because there are too many to handle in a query (there is a limit of 10,000 results from the MWAPI service). --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 10:45, 2 July 2020 (UTC) Country with all relationships related to econocmic and demografic variables could have it Hello:Could you help me with an example oriented to query for a list of all countries with their relationships related to econocmic and demografic variables?Thank you very muchMario Hi Mario.

How to former official city names? Hello everyone. Does anyone has a clue, how I can get old official place names? For example city (Q515) has several official names. But if I query the property, I get only the new one. How could I get all of the Place names? Old official names included? sincerely, Erik --22:58, 24 February 2018‎ special:contribs/snjuk Arlo Barnes (talk) 04:09, 5 July 2020 (UTC) @Arlo Barnes: You need to be more specific about which names for which cities you are talking about. Often the currently valid name(s) have preferred rank, while historic names have normal rank. That means that queries for the best rank values of e.g. official name (P1448) with wdt:P1448 only gives the current names. That is so by design. You can instead query for all ranks with first p:P1448 to get IRIs for all full statements with P1448 and then use ps:P1448 to get all values. You will need the full statements to get qualifiers like start time (P580) and end time (P582) anyway. If you ask a more precise question, I can demonstrate this with a query. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 06:31, 5 July 2020 (UTC) Mayors Hello.

There are so many Elo rating (P1087) claims (2.3M) that practically every query involving this property is at the edge of timing out.

 Try it! Is it possible to write an equivalent query to find articles that do not have the corresponding category? So an item that has position held (P39):Member of the 1386 Parliament (Q56285355), with a linked enwiki article, but where that article is not in \"English MPs 1386\". I feel like it should be, but I can't quite work out how to do it. Andrew Gray (talk) 20:28, 11 July 2020 (UTC) @Andrew Gray: First, beware that if the Wikipedia category contains articles without a Wikidata item, then there will be results where ?item is unbound, and the query above will be likely to timeout in that case. As for requested query it can sometimes be a little tricky to get the SPARQL engine to do queries with mwapi service calls in a correct order.

Andrew Gray (talk) 10:38, 12 July 2020 (UTC)  Honda Sports Award alma mater Original query (from Wikidata:Project chat): I need some help creating a query. what I really want is a list of the alma mater for winners of the Honda Sports Award (Q5892712) when the article does not have a photo. That last aspect might be tricky (although maybe not because one could check to see if there is an image), but I already have a list of winners for which there is no photo, so if I have a list of all winners and their alma mater, I can merge that with my list and identify those without photos. I see that as a field for educated at but it can include both high school and college. I'm only interested in college but if I get both I think I can figure out how to throw away the high school. There are a number of Honda sports awards such as on the sports award for volleyball, on the sports award for basketball but all of them should be part of Honda Sports Award (Q5892712). My goal is to generate a list that I can dump into Excel for other purposes. It may be helpful to point out that there are 487 award winners, 314 of which have Wikipedia articles. 144 these articles do have a photo, and 170 do not. --Sphilbrick (talk) 00:28, 12 July 2020 (UTC) @Sphilbrick: Try this: SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?personLabel ?school ?schoolLabel WHERE {

 Try it! The query above, in English, is more or less saying \"select every person who has recieved a Honda Sports Award or a kind of Honda Sports Award, who was educated at a school that is a higher education institution or some kind of higher education institution.\" It's not simple to filter on Wikipedia pages having images from within the Wikidata query service (I'm not entirely sure if it's possible); however you should be able to do that with PetScan. You can check whether an item has an image on Wikidata using the commented-out line.Note that some people, such as Kathy Butler (Q6377194), appear multiple times in the list because they have multiple higher education institutions.If you have your spreadsheet in the form of Wikipedia article titles the following modification might be useful, to have it output Wikipedia article titles instead of labels: SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?articleTitle ?school ?schoolLabel WHERE {
  ?person wdt:P166/wdt:P31 wd:Q5892712.

Is it the Wikidata items or articles in e.g. English Wikipedia or other Wikipedias about the award winner or some other articles? If the latter, what if the award winner doesn't have an article? Is it any image in the article, or must it be images picturing the award winners? --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 07:25, 12 July 2020 (UTC) Another question: Is it a list of Alma maters you want with a list of winners for each college, or a list of winners with a list of schools for each winner?

To Dipsacus fullonum, some good questions, and I do care about images of the award winner, but I've looked at all of these articles in the course of compiling my list and I'm fairly certain there are no articles with images but no image of the award winner. My reference to the article was the English Wikipedia article. There are quite a few award winners without an article, but that's a project for another day.Sphilbrick (talk) 12:58, 12 July 2020 (UTC) I don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth, but creating these queries is outside my area of expertise (I know I need to learn), and I'm trying to figure out what went wrong. Curiously the number of items in my list is close to the number of items in your list, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of overlap. I sorted both list alphabetically.The first five items in my list are: Alaina Bergsma Alex Jupiter Alex McMurtry Allison Weston Alyssa Manley The first five items in your list are: Abbey D'Agostino Abby Dahlkemper A'ja Wilson Alexandra Jupiter Allison Schmitt Alex Jupiter, a.k.a. Alexandra Jupiter it appears in both lists so that one is fine. I've looked at the other four in my list and confirmed that they are players who won a Honda sports award and have no image in this information is reflected in both the Wikipedia article and the wikidata entry so I am not clear why none of them showed up in your list.On the other hand, the first item in your list Abbey D'Agostino aka Abbey Cooper is a Honda sports award winner but clearly has an image in the English Wikipedia article and in wikidata. Similarly, Abby Dahlkemper as an image in both the English Wikipedia and and wikidata.It will help, I created a list of all the award winners without an image and copied it to a Google sheet, sorted by name: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rdAEENep_2VvK2N8_5S-NiXhZpKptLIY-pxlgWL5TiE/edit?usp=sharing --Sphilbrick (talk) 19:27, 12 July 2020 (UTC) @Sphilbrick: Here is a query doing what you asked for.

 Try it! @Dipsacus fullonum: I assume all I had to do was click on the run button, but that only generated 14 entries. As an aside I see some of those winners do not have their school in wiki data so I started adding them. Not sure why there's only 14 entries though. @Sphilbrick: Yes, there are only 14 entries that fulfill the requirements. Remember that I asked if the images should be picturing the award winners, and I read the answer as that a test for that wasn't necessary. Therefore all award winners with articles having images are removed from the result, for instance for w:Kathy Jordan, w:Debbie Green-Vargas, w:Jenny Thompson, w:Jackie Stiles and many others where the articles have images of various flags, medals, portal icons and similar. You get what you ask for. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 22:11, 12 July 2020 (UTC) This isn't working. I think part of the problem is many of the articles did not have an alma mater listed.

Chidgk1 (talk) 17:02, 14 July 2020 (UTC) @Chidgk1: Yes, it includes / wdt:P279 * because power plants may not be marked directly as instances of power station (Q159719), but as instances of various subclasses like instances of thermal solar power station (Q285927), nuclear power plant (Q134447), wind farm (Q194356) and others. So ?item wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q159719 says that ?item is instance of (P31) something that is subclass of (P279) of power station (Q159719). The * means that there may be any number (including 0) of iterations of P279. [AUTO_LANGUAGE],en means that labels in the language of the user interface is selected first. If none exist in that language, then labels in English (\"en\") is selected. If also none exist in English, then the Q number of the item is displayed instead of an label.

 Try it! --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 06:24, 15 July 2020 (UTC) @Dipsacus fullonum: Awesome. Now I have some work to do! Thank you. Trilotat (talk) 16:39, 16 July 2020 (UTC) tool/ query idea: cast members' age at time of movie release I think this would be a great tool that lots of people would find useful. maybe it's more dynamic than the usual here; let me know. QUERY: how old are the \"top\" (5-20) cast members of a movie at the time the movie is released? rough example* film : Closer (2004)Jude Law - 32Natalie Portman - 23Julia Roberts - 37Clive Owen - 40maybe throw the director in there too- Mike Nichols - 73maybe this is completely unrealistic, but I at least want to see what you guys think or how to take steps to build something like this. thanks.
