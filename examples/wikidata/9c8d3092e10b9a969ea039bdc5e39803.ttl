We have \"Precision\" so worse case you have to set it to the right millennium. Multichill (talk) 22:55, 26 February 2016 (UTC) Not always. Person can die somewhere in the end of 20th century, but it can also be 21st century. --Edgars2007 (talk) 23:22, 26 February 2016 (UTC) There are many historical people for who our only information is that they were alive in a given year, say 1480. We do not know if they were aged 20 or 80 in that year, or whether they died aged 21 or 121. Their date of death (and similarly birth) is truly not known to any precision. Thryduulf (talk: local | en.wp | en.wikt) 22:23, 27 February 2016 (UTC) That's not totally true, it's just an information display problem. You can enter a date with a precision of the century, and only the century is displayed. The correct way would be to show the two centuries in the UI, but it's not done yet (if somebody wants to code, it's on my TODo list since forever /o\\) author TomT0m / talk page 12:39, 1 March 2016 (UTC) I don't think there is any consensus about what the precision means. It is especially confusing because the before and after attributes are present and documented, but not in use and always set to 0. At least in the case of days, some Phabricator discussions have indicated that after = 0 and after =1 would have the same meaning. That is, when before = after = 0, this does not indicate an exact value; there is no method to indicate an exact value.

Basically, every teacher in my Wikipedia watchlist shows the edit, which I think should not be the desired behaviour, as it clutters the Wikipedia watchlist (there are plenty of these, all the time). Am I doing something wrong? (I don't think I did anything specific for this) I've been directed to phab:T90435 ([Epic] Wikidata watchlist improvements (client)) but I'm not sure it covers this point.

So if you want to see Wikidata edits in your watchlist, you'll see 1 edit on all articles that are on your watchlist and have a link to the edited item. You can turn off showing Wikidata edits in your settings on frwiki. Mbch331 (talk) 17:56, 29 February 2016 (UTC) @Mbch331: I do not wish to turn off showing all Wikidata edits, I only wish to see Wikidata edits on items on my watchlist, not items linked to them. For instance, if i have fr:Abraham Adolf Fraenkel in my frwiki watchlist, I would understand to see edits on Abraham Fraenkel (Q61043), but I should really not see edits labelled Abraham Adolf Fraenkel (Q37226). Place Clichy (talk) 10:19, 1 March 2016 (UTC) @Lea Lacroix (WMDE): Can you say anything about this? Mbch331 (talk) 11:23, 1 March 2016 (UTC) I'll look into it. How often is this happening for people? Is it super annoying because it happens all the time? Or is this a rather exceptional case? --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 12:01, 1 March 2016 (UTC) The problem is that there isn't really a way to know that it wasn't the label of \"Étienne-Louis Boullée\" that was changed to \"enseignante\", but the label of Q37226 which is \"teacher\". This doesn't exactly described the same sample above, but it is similar to something I found odd at Meta when viewing changes at Wikidata from there. A possible solution could be: to move the QID to the space after the name of the user and include the current label of the item. Maybe there should also be an indication of the link to that item (is it the one of the article or a linked one). For linked items, a consolidated view could be preferable (1 diff not 173). This at least from my POV. Maybe Place Clichy wants to suggest something else. --- Jura 12:21, 1 March 2016 (UTC) @Lydia Pintscher (WMDE): This is happening all the time, I can't remember when it started. My frwiki watchlist has 13 465 items on it, and I'm having a real hard time reading it due to such cluttering from WD edits appearing dozens of times, for items I'm not even following. I understand that changes (especially on labels) on \"property\" items can affect the Wikipedia article and are therefore legitimate on the WP watchlist, but there seem to be several things worth a cleanup : As I wrote here, showing changes to a mother class of a property are imho overkill. Whenever someone edits human (Q5) or person (Q215627), it's mayhem. The language issue has been reported many times before (only show edits to labels/records in the local Wikipedia language) Consolidating these 173 lines on 1 line (for 1 diff) would be a great improvement The label issue mentioned by Jura1 would also be an improvement but I would give it a lower priority and I can't tell the best way to display it: in my example above, the watchlist shows Abraham Adolf Fraenkel (Q37226) which is misleading. fr:Abraham Adolf Fraenkel (the article in my frwiki watchlist) is linked to Abraham Fraenkel (Q61043), and this item links to teacher (Q37226), which is where the edit took place. Again, I can't tell if (especially point 1) is a bug, the expected behaviour, or something already listed in the watchlist integration improvement! Place Clichy (talk) 14:50, 1 March 2016 (UTC) I understand, that this isn't solution to the problem itself, but you may try using this gadget, that allows filtering. Very nice in such cases. If you're interested, then copy content from this page to your common.js page. --Edgars2007 (talk) 15:02, 1 March 2016 (UTC) Thanks, folks.

For instance people on the great Americans series? Thanks, GerardM (talk) 07:37, 28 February 2016 (UTC) I guess you could use a property like present in work (P1441), however this one is restricted to fictional entities. So either expand the scope of that one to include all kind of entities, or propose a new property.--Micru (talk) 10:06, 28 February 2016 (UTC) The reverse. Create an item for the stamp, and use \"depicts (P180)\".

Thanks, GerardM (talk) 19:34, 28 February 2016 (UTC) Something like \"1980 17p Moorhen\" (year, value, subject). Possibly also prefixed by country. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 21:00, 1 March 2016 (UTC) SPARQL report for item constraints I'd like to add SPARQL report link to Template:Constraint:Item along with current WDQ link. It would look like this: User:Laboramus/Test/P2549 (compare with Property_talk:P2549). Basically the change would be adding one \"SPARQL\" link where it says \"Report:\". Are there any objections to this? Does anybody see any problems with the concept or implementation? --Laboramus (talk) 02:02, 1 March 2016 (UTC) Looks good. As WQS doesn't display labels by default, maybe a column for these could be added too. BTW even the Autolist link could be changed to use SPARQL as source. Eventually we might want to support exceptions= and items= as well. --- Jura 09:20, 1 March 2016 (UTC) Looks good to me, too. BTW, related suggestion. Maybe we can add this kind of reports for (some) constraint templates? The eqiuvalent SPARQL should be this one.

One probable result is that when this happens, all wikis will be in read-only mode for a short time, likely less than 15 minutes for all editors. You will be able to read pages, but not edit them. \"All wikis\" means all of the WMF wikis, including Wikidata, Meta, Commons, the Wikipedias, and all the sister projects. It may affect some related sites, such as mw:Wikimedia Labs (including the Tool Labs). There will also be no non-emergency updates to MediaWiki software around that time.Many details are still being sorted out. I am asking you to please share the word with your friends and fellow contributors now. This will be mentioned in m:Tech/News (subscribe now! ;-) and through all the other usual channels for Ops, but 99% of contributors don't follow those pages. If you are active in other projects or speak other languages, then please share the news with your fellow contributors at other projects, so that whenever it happens, most people will know that everything should be back online in 10 or 15 minutes.Thanks, Whatamidoing (WMF) (talk) 16:37, 2 March 2016 (UTC) identifier datatype is available and conversion is in progress Hey folks :)We have enabled the new datatype for identifiers now. New properties will start showing up at Special:ListProperties/external-id. As announced we will also start converting existing properties with datatype string that should be external identifiers. We will start with the first eleven from User:Addshore/Identifiers/0. We will do more over the coming days. There are still a lot of properties to go through so please help with that so we can get this over with quickly to cause minimal disruption to 3rd parties relying on our data. You will also see the identifiers that are already converted moving to a new section at the bottom of the item pages. This might need a purge still though to clear the cache.Cheers --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 18:09, 17 February 2016 (UTC) For the move to happen on items, it seems that the statement with the property needs to be edited. At least purging by users doesn't seem to be sufficient. The RDF version doesn't seem to include the URL either. --- Jura 18:34, 17 February 2016 (UTC) Thanks. Will look into it. RDF isn't implemented yet but coming soon. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 18:36, 17 February 2016 (UTC) I'm currently mass purging all items affected by the initial round of property conversions. If no further problems occur, VIAF ID (P214) will get done early tomorrow, other properties will follow.

Which URL would a SPARQL search return? Jheald (talk) 01:31, 18 February 2016 (UTC) We will provide both based on the different statements on the property. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 11:07, 18 February 2016 (UTC) Is there a way to enable formatter URLs also for other property types? (e.g. monolingual text or strings) --- Jura 18:01, 18 February 2016 (UTC) I think so, yes. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 19:29, 18 February 2016 (UTC) Do you think this could be roled out at the same time as the RDF part? --- Jura 07:14, 19 February 2016 (UTC) I'll check. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 09:30, 19 February 2016 (UTC) So technically it is a bit of a pita but if absolutely needed we can make it work it seems. Do you have some cases where it'd be needed? --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 11:55, 2 March 2016 (UTC) Great! On User:Multichill/Paintings creator no authority control I have a list of properties that could probably be converted right away. Did anyone already try to do an intersection on Category:Properties with string-datatype & Category:Properties with unique value constraints & Category:Properties with single value constraints? That should return a bunch of obvious candidates. Multichill (talk) 13:52, 19 February 2016 (UTC) I don't think that has been done yet. Good idea. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 15:59, 19 February 2016 (UTC) Hi Multichill - I was thinking of doing something like that, however, deciding what the actual criteria should be has been a little frustrating. Could you review the discussion at User:Addshore/Identifiers and comment there on what you think we ought to do? A criterion as you suggest makes some sense, though I'm not sure on the necessity of Category:Properties with single value constraints. We did go through pretty much every property in Category:Properties with string-datatype one way or another. I have some analysis on usage patterns here. ArthurPSmith (talk) 18:51, 19 February 2016 (UTC) Is there a way of marking possible properties to migrate to this datatype? p:P717 might be one to consider changing. Thanks. Mike Peel (talk) 22:17, 25 February 2016 (UTC) Railways Archive event ID (P2478) can also be converted (I would have proposed it as an identifier data type had I known that was imminent). Thryduulf (talk: local | en.wp | en.wikt) 01:28, 26 February 2016 (UTC) @Mike Peel: we were concerned about the number of constraint violations on P717 - see Wikidata:Database_reports/Constraint_violations/P717#.22Unique_value.22_violations. Are these being addressed or are these duplicate etc. values correct? @Thryduulf: - I suggest you add it yourself to the \"good to convert\" list under User:Addshore/Identifiers/2. Best of luck! ArthurPSmith (talk) 18:57, 26 February 2016 (UTC) @ArthurPSmith: Thanks for the pointer to the database report! I've started going through that and clearing up the problems. Some of the duplicates, e.g. STEREO (Q182766), are deliberate, but others aren't. Thanks. Mike Peel (talk) 20:27, 26 February 2016 (UTC) Hi, is ISNI to be converted soon ? I was working on some items and the only identifier left unconverted was ISNI. Thanks for the migration. It really looks neat now :) --Hsarrazin (talk) 00:05, 3 March 2016 (UTC) Thanks :) We're continuing to convert things as they are moved to \"good to convert\" at User:Addshore/Identifiers/0, User:Addshore/Identifiers/1 and User:Addshore/Identifiers/2. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 08:09, 3 March 2016 (UTC) Unless we want to leave the linking to the gadget, I don't think we can convert this one for now. Some development is still needed. Not sure when this will happen.--- Jura 08:15, 3 March 2016 (UTC) I have a question which I also has added to WD:DEV: What will be result of this conversion when there is more than one formatter URL (P1630) for a property. P:P2182 has three, depending on your preferred language. -- Innocent bystander (talk) 08:22, 3 March 2016 (UTC) In this case it should take the preferred one. We can look at making the link depend on the user's language but that is definitely not trivial and I don't know yet when we can do that. --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 08:26, 3 March 2016 (UTC) I do not care what happens here in the GUI at Wikidata, that is of minor importance. It is what will be transported to the Clients that bother me. svwiki as a project has a POV for its own language. And I guess fiwiki has the same kind of POV, but for another language. -- Innocent bystander (talk) 08:30, 3 March 2016 (UTC) There is https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T107407 about this. --- Jura 08:44, 3 March 2016 (UTC) List of data licenses for different government's data Hi allIs anyone aware of a list of the different data licenses governments use? I'm thinking perhaps there may be something similar to the Freedom of Panorama page on Commons.ThanksJohn Cummings (talk) 14:23, 1 March 2016 (UTC) just a note this is something I've run into in my work (not that I've seen a good solution) - we have our own rather ad hoc list of governments with \"Crown\" copyright rules, the US government employee rules, etc. ArthurPSmith (talk) @ArthurPSmith: thanks, do you think its worth starting a page with this information on? I can see it being useful for people wanting to import data from different sources. --John Cummings (talk) 15:40, 2 March 2016 (UTC) In Sweden (Q34) You have to look at each document! -- Innocent bystander (talk) 15:45, 2 March 2016 (UTC) Would it be helpful to create a page on Wikidata called something like 'Government data licensing' that listed all the licenses used by different governments, with the aim of highlighting data that can be imported into Wikidata? I feel like this would be very useful but I'm a bit stuck with the name. John Cummings (talk) 16:36, 3 March 2016 (UTC) It would be nice, but I am afraid that the list will be very short? United States: Free in many cases. Europe: No, with a few exceptions! Rest of the World: Probably not! -- Innocent bystander (talk) 17:22, 3 March 2016 (UTC) Scripts loaded in common.js not working in Chrome When using Wikidata in Chrome I'm missing several functions. These are all loaded from scripts in my common.js. When I check my browserconsole I see the following error: Refused to execute script from 'https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=User:Magnus_Manske/suggestor.js&action=raw&ctype=js' because its MIME type ('text/x-wiki') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled. (for each non-working script 1 line). I don't know how to make them work under Chrome. I don't have FireFox present on my work PC. Does anyone know how to solve this? Mbch331 (talk) 22:39, 1 March 2016 (UTC) Solved it myself. The solution is to change the ctype part of the url to ctype=text/javascript, then it does work. Then the content type is set to text/javascript instead of text/x-wiki and the scripts are executed. Mbch331 (talk) 20:37, 2 March 2016 (UTC) Wiki mark-up in string-type properties Several users in frwiki, and apparently other wikis as well are pushing for the use of Wiki-markup in Wikidata, like image caption : [[John Doe]] and [[John Smith]] at the {{numeral|2}} edition of the competition.That makes the statement unreadable anywhere but in a particular Wiki and on the whole I think it is really bad idea. But still, it would be useful if string-type properties supported more formatting options, like italics, superscripts, line breaks, and even, for some properties, internal links. Should we have a more explicit policy about this. Other thoughts ? @Lydia Pintscher (WMDE), Molarus:.--Zolo (talk) 07:09, 2 March 2016 (UTC) I am very much against introducing formatting options in the string datatype as is because this defeats the whole point of what we are doing here. We can think about introducing other datatypes for a rare number of cases where it does make sense to have formatting but I doubt there will be significant ones. Can you say what the usecases are that they want to use formatting for in strings? Image captions will be handled as we make progress on Commons support. Any other cases? --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 11:44, 2 March 2016 (UTC) Italics, subscript, superscripts, and line breaks would have relatively wide use for inscription (P1684) and quotation (P1683), and, I think, more occasional use for other monolingual text properties. Actually, it would also sometimes be useful in for labels as well (eg foreign loanwords should usually be italicized in French). --Zolo (talk) 12:36, 2 March 2016 (UTC) It seems to me it would be reasonable to introduce another string-based datatype (like the mathematical formula type) that is a \"formatted string\" or \"interpreted string\" for certain properties. Many programming languages have two different string types, one for raw text (single quoted strings in perl, ruby, etc.) and one for text allowing run-time substitutions (double-quoted strings). ArthurPSmith (talk) 14:37, 2 March 2016 (UTC) I have inserted this code in a lua module: string.gsub(s, \"{{(%w+)}}\", function (n) return frame:expandTemplate{ title = n } end) to make templates in image captions work. And now I am adding code for dealing with references, but the formatting will be in the code, not in Wikidata values. --Molarus 16:30, 2 March 2016 (UTC) @Molarus: the {{Templates}} markup is in Wikidata, which is only usable in (one) Wikipedia, and should be avoided. --Zolo (talk) 17:56, 2 March 2016 (UTC) It is no problem, because the templates are used in a monolingual text, which is seen only in the wiki that inserted the template into the monolingual text. And if no template is inserted into the image caption, the code does no harm. A problem might arise someday if a value is used in different ways, but the solution is here to have similar code or to filter formatting code out of the value. --Molarus 18:16, 2 March 2016 (UTC) which is seen only in the wiki that inserted the template: I don't agree with you. For example there are 10 Wikimedia wikis that would display an image description in German (de.wikipedia, de.wikisource, de.wikiquote, de.wikibooks, de.wikinews, de.wikiversity, de.wikivoyage, wikispecies, commons) and I am not counting here usages outside Wikimedia worlds. Tpt (talk) 21:27, 2 March 2016 (UTC) OK, there are some wikis that could show that info too. If they have the same template as wikipedia, they will see the same image caption. Where is the problem? A problem could arise if I´m using a value in different ways, but I don´t see that as a possibility for captions or text in general. Another possible problem could arise if there are templates with the same name but different functions. By and large, I see the possibility of small problems in the future if formatting code is inserted into wikidata text (!) values. On the other hand, the users get the same features they are used to in wikipedia. I think, we should try to make editors happy, while we pay for that with more work. --Molarus 06:41, 3 March 2016 (UTC) The problem is that nobody is expected to treat the property as formatted text, nor is there any guarantee that if they do, that they have a template with the same name and if they do have one, that it will work the same way. Wikidata is designed to store data which can be reused by everyone, it's not designed to store data tailored to one specific project - that can be stored locally. Ultimately, I don't think Wikidata is even the right place for image captions, it would make more sense as structured data on Commons (which I think was what Lydia was also implying). - Nikki (talk) 09:34, 3 March 2016 (UTC) There are even more than that, as smaller wikis may want to fall back to German if the info isn't available in their language yet (there are 15 other languages shown as falling back to German on commons:File:MediaWiki fallback chains.svg...). - Nikki (talk) 09:34, 3 March 2016 (UTC) It was actual meant for frWP to show something like 1er. I wouldn´t mind to have \"sup\" instead of the template, but I don´t like to \"correct\" other peoples text. Another possible use case are right-to-left names in captions, e.g. names of persons. There is a need for formatted text, I´m sure. By the way, pattern matching is central to lua and to this problem. It´s magic! I would never use the parser function #property --Molarus 11:54, 3 March 2016 (UTC) Strong support to a formatted text datatype (with visual editor?). About allowing templates, I am not so sure, at least not at the beginning. --Micru (talk) 10:55, 3 March 2016 (UTC) In taxonomy, titles of books and papers that include names in italics are commonplace, so markup would be useful. - Brya (talk) 11:38, 3 March 2016 (UTC) A new datatype for such values would be sensible. It could either be qualified by the home wiki (like we currently qualify langauges of works) or the markup could be expressed like [[:fr:John Doe]], with [[John Doe]] forms causing an error message.

The data is gathered as part of the Address-Based Population Registration System (Q6042918). There is an interactive query tool on biruni.tuik.gov.tr. How to cite the population count properly? Would stated in (P248)/described by source (P1343) be sufficient or do I need to include retrieved (P813) or title (P1476)? --1-Byte (talk) 10:08, 2 March 2016 (UTC) @1-Byte: apparently query tool is an interface for the report generated by Address-Based Population Registration System (Q6042918) , so you should source the report with stated in (P248) as Help:Sources suggests (by creating item for the report). -- Hakan·IST 10:44, 2 March 2016 (UTC) @1-Byte: Use Help:Sources but follow the database section: Address-Based Population Registration System (Q6042918) is a database, not a legal text. Snipre (talk) 13:02, 2 March 2016 (UTC) @Snipre: It is a live updating database, note that you'd be sourcing the 'report' generated by Query Tool at the time of import. -- Hakan·IST 13:20, 2 March 2016 (UTC) @HakanIST: Is the report generated by the system an official document ? With some authors, ISBN, DOI or other identifiers ? By report we mean a document which is not generated by an automatic system from a continuously updating database. Snipre (talk) 18:54, 2 March 2016 (UTC) @Snipre: I found an official press release which includes some tables about provinces. These documents are now included as 2015 Turkish census (Q22987520). The data about districts is not included though. --1-Byte (talk) 21:40, 2 March 2016 (UTC) No I think you don't understand the difference: a document can't be generated by an automatic system and what you have for 2015 Turkish census (Q22987520) is press release not an official document providing all the data at the end of 2015. As example have a look at the press release of census data for Switzerland there but this can be used to source only what is in hte press release and not other data from the database. Your press relaese just mention some data of the database at a specific date. It can be sued as source for the data you have on the press realease but not for the missing data from the text. A document is something like that or like that which can be retrieved by everyone in the wolrd just by mentioning its title or one of its identifiers like ISBN. It's something which contains all the data you want to cite. Why don't you use the data structure for databases in source section ? Snipre (talk) 22:53, 2 March 2016 (UTC) ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘@Snipre: I see, this is definitly not optimal. However there is an option to download the tables at the end of the release (not dynamically generated). Would that be OK (at least for the provinces)? Regarding the source section: According to Help:Sources#Databases databases without an identifier should be treated like webpages. I tried to follow the advice in this section.

What I've noticed is how often people confuse the two. I'm about to work extensively on getting these right wherever I see an issue.However before I start I would like to make sure I'm right and the community agrees with me.For example a Vegetable is defined as being the part of a plant that you eat. There are pages and pages of instances of vegetable for example beet (Q165437) or asparagus (Q28367) which are all defined as instances of vegetable, but in my mind they should all be subclasses.This is better summed up as if it were code. If Vegetable had a method called rot obviously it would not be the class Vegetable that rots but an instance of a vegetable that rots. It's also evident that it's not the class tomato that rots but an physical instance of tomato. Hence tomato being an instance of vegetable does not make sense, it should be a subclass.Does everyone agree with me? Any ideas? Thoughts? I'm also worried that some people might not understand the difference between instance and subclass and might change it back. By Thewormsterror. AFAIK, there is a loose interpretation of instance here, we don't use it only for real life unique instances, but it is more like a tree of classes where the last element is an instance. It is improbable that we will have real instances of beetroot, so it is not a big deal. Perhaps it would be more useful if combined with quantity (P1114) but it is quite unlikely that we could source the number of beetroot in the world, other than with weight estimates. In the end I think it is a question of practicality, do you have some practical application in mind where it would make a difference to consider beetroot a subclass of vegetable instead of an instance?--Micru (talk) 10:46, 3 March 2016 (UTC) I don't agree with this and I push help:Classification. This loose interpretation is not useful for any purpose and we totally lose the interest of having two properties. If we want to take that approach, w should just create a new property is a and add it to the items that is a superproperty of both instance of and subclass of. Plus the dichotomy instance of (P31) / subclass of (P279) has been used to solve problems about for example differenciate the type of administrative division in some project out here and the divisions themselves (paris / french city / french administration division) which are a mess without using the dichotomy. The most important feature is that subclass is transitive, whereas instance of is not : an instance A of an instance B of some class C is not an instance of C, so that Paris is not a type of french administrative division. author TomT0m / talk page 12:42, 3 March 2016 (UTC) I just read your Classification document. I agree with you almost completely TomT0m, I just have some hesitations about things being both instances and subclasses, I don't disagree I just have to think about it more. Being quite knew to wikidata though, I don't know how things work here. As a new user can I just go and change things as I see fit and assume no moderator will flag me or change them back? I know this matters little but I have a lot of qualifications when it comes to making models, so I know what I am doing. I plan on using wikidata a lot in the future for various projects, and the accuracy of the data is important to me. Thewormsterror (talk) 18:07, 3 March 2016 (UTC) @Thewormsterror: I'd just like to point out the original example above with \"Vegetable\" seems wrong to me - either the instance of (P31) statements should be changed to subclass of (P279) or vegetable (Q11004) should be replaced in the statements by something that has the form of a metaclass - \"type of vegetable\" or something like that. All that said, the bio hierarchy is a bit complicated and there are some people with strong opinions there so I would consult a bit (eg. here or talk pages or an RFC) before trying any major changes. ArthurPSmith (talk) 21:02, 3 March 2016 (UTC) @ArthurPSmith: It's not really bio hierarchy, because a vegetable is an edible plant or a part of an edible plant. It goes across taxons. To me it's obvious that an asparagus should be a subclass of vegetable. I'll wait a week and unless I get any strong objections in this thread I will change it.

Could be something of that simply missing? --Janezdrilc (talk) 22:43, 1 March 2016 (UTC) I couldn't reproduce what I just wrote. {{#time:d. xg|{{#property:p569}}|sl}} and {{#time:d. xg|{{#property:p569|from=Q76}}|sl}} work on Q76 at enwiki, but not on slwiki. I think it's probably something to fix for the devs. As they are working on localized dates, maybe they could look into this as well or are already doing it. @Lydia Pintscher (WMDE):. --- Jura 23:00, 1 March 2016 (UTC) Noted. Thanks! :) --Lydia Pintscher (WMDE) (talk) 11:45, 2 March 2016 (UTC) {{#property:P569}} produces: 13 januar 1886, but the time function wants {{#time: xg | 13 january 1886 }} with a \"y\". I think Wikidata returns the local name, but the time function wants the english name. A #switch should do the translation. --Molarus 02:06, 2 March 2016 (UTC) @Molarus: I've been testing some dates on sl.wiki. If the date include following months: apr, sep, nov, dec, the translation is done correctly. If the date include remaining months: jan, feb, mar, may, jun, jul, aug, oct, the translation is done incorrectly. This applies in all articles. Some other wikis also have problems with translation, including de, cs, pl, ru, sk, uk. --Janezdrilc (talk) 11:28, 4 March 2016 (UTC) I think Molarus is right. It seems it needs to be done with LUA. Module:Wikidata has {{#invoke:Wikidata|formatStatementsE|item=Q76|property=p569|displayformat=raw}} (+1961-08-04T00:00:00Z). With {{#time:d. xg|{{#invoke:Wikidata|formatStatementsE|item=Q76|property=p569|displayformat=raw}}|sl}}, it works here (04. avgusta), but requires the same version of Module:Wikidata to work elsewhere. Ideally the entire thing is done in one LUA function. It would also need to check if the date has day-precision. --- Jura 11:27, 4 March 2016 (UTC) Revert Q6581072 Would someone revert the edit of Pigsonthewing on that item? Apparently, they don't want to discuss what they are doing and per Property_talk:P2559 we are not ready yet. --- Jura 02:57, 4 March 2016 (UTC) I have undone the edit, as the instructions should remain until the usage notes statement is supported (which I hope is being worked on as a matter of priority) but I cannot see any evidence that you (Jura1) or anyone else has actually tried to discuss this with Pigsonthewing so saying he doesn't want to discuss is not necessarily accurate. Thryduulf (talk: local | en.wp | en.wikt) 13:41, 4 March 2016 (UTC) Thanks. Someone removed what might be the evidence you are looking for. --- Jura 13:46, 4 March 2016 (UTC) Help Commons categories Where is the rght location in a item like Q880229 for the Commons category: Identifiers or statements? And for links to Wiktionary pages. Thanks--Pierpao (talk) 13:45, 4 March 2016 (UTC) For Commons, you can use either (click \"add\"), it gets displayed depending on how the property is defined. For Wiktionary pages, I don't think any properties are available yet. --- Jura 13:53, 4 March 2016 (UTC) Merge problem I made a mistake and can't undo it. I've merged Q21041415 into Q7232681, thinking it was the same thing. The only page it existed of Q21041415 was this. I've press undo, but the wikidata item now only redirects. To clarify, one is a sports association of roller hockey, and other is of field hockey, I've no idea that there were two different federations.--Threeohsix (talk) 19:47, 4 March 2016 (UTC) I undid the merge for you. Next time, go to the item that is a redirect (In this case: Portuguese Field Hockey Federation (Q21041415)). It will lead you to the page you merged it into (in this case Portuguese Roller Sports Federation (Q7232681)), then click on the link that points to the redirect page (Q21041415). You'll only see a link. Click on history and compare the last edit with 2 edits before. Than choose undo. Now the item is back into the state it was before you started the merge procedure. Mbch331 (talk) 20:55, 4 March 2016 (UTC) Where is the Universal Language Selector Hi everyone, I'd like to change my language preferences but I can't find the \"Universal Language Selector\" which is supposed to be present \"at top of pages\" as mentioned here.--Kimdime (talk) 23:04, 4 March 2016 (UTC) In this example, it's the \"English\" link --YMS (talk) 23:16, 4 March 2016 (UTC) Hi YMS, so apparently I was misled and asked the wrong question. I'm totally fine with the interface language, what I wanted was to change the label and description default language interface. Thanks to Help:Navigating Wikidata/User Options I managed to do it through the babel infoboxes, but I'd rather not have those boxes in my user page, I'd like to do it through the preferences but somehow I don't manage it that way (didn't find any \"Internationalisation\" section in my user profile).--Kimdime (talk) 23:37, 4 March 2016 (UTC) Decoding P1172 Geokod (P1172) has Type:class= administrative territorial entity (Q56061) as a constraint. That is fine. But the code itself gives more information. A code of type: NN00000 is a County. A code of type: XXNN000 is a Hundred, Tingslag or Skeppslag. A code of type: XXXXNN0 is a Municipality. Thereof: XXXXX80 is a City and XXXXX90 is a Market town. A code of type: XXXXXXN is a (subclass of) Parish if N=1,2,3/is a Municipalsamhälle if N=4,5,6,7,8/is a \"Market town who does not form a municipality\" if N=9 (There are two exceptions for N=3) Can this information be used here in any way? -- Innocent bystander (talk) 07:42, 3 March 2016 (UTC) Not with the normal constraints, but if you know how to write SPARQL, you can use Template:Complex constraint. Mbch331 (talk) 11:14, 3 March 2016 (UTC) Many of these have \"instance of:former municipality in Sweden\". It is technically correct, but \"former municipality\" has a number of subclasses, with more detailed information! -- Innocent bystander (talk) 12:59, 3 March 2016 (UTC) I just discovered that administrative territorial entity (Q56061) maybe is a little to limiting for this property. WD do not regard Swedish parishes as an administrative entity. (They used to be, but are not anymore.) And unincorporated Market towns is more of a \"populated place\" than a administrative territorial entity (Q56061). I have changed the constraints now, but I do not want to have \"subclass of any item in this list\". I prefer \"is instance of any item in this list\". Is that possible? -- Innocent bystander (talk) 10:00, 4 March 2016 (UTC) @Innocent bystander: From what I understand you just have to create an item \"type of geokod populated place\", mark ⟨ County ⟩ instance of (P31) ⟨ type of geokod populated place ⟩ ; ⟨ Hundred ⟩ instance of (P31) ⟨ type of geokod populated place ⟩ ; ... then with sparql do something like SELECT ?place WHERE {
    ?admintype wdt:P31 wd:Qtype_of_geokod_populated_place .
    ?place wdt:P31 ?admintype
}
 Try it! that will select any place that is an instance of anything that is an instance of the types of geokod @TomT0m: SPARQL is far far beyond my knowledge. -- Innocent bystander (talk) 17:50, 5 March 2016 (UTC) Metrolyrics I wanted to propose a new property for lyrics at MetroLyrics (Q6824428), but then found, that it's kind of part of full work available at URL (P953), see example at Never Gonna Give You Up (Q57). So, what should I do? Propose the property or not do that and not waste everybody's tyme at proposal page? Theoretically, I'm fine with P953, but property for Metrolyrics would ease life, I think (it could then be used at Wikipedia templates etc.). --Edgars2007 (talk) 20:05, 4 March 2016 (UTC) I think a specific property would be beneficial; even if others disagree, having the discussion is not a waste of time. Please go ahead. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 20:48, 4 March 2016 (UTC) I also think a specific property would be useful. en:Template:MetroLyrics song has nearly 20,000 uses on enwiki alone. - Nikki (talk) 21:19, 4 March 2016 (UTC) OK, made the proposal, will see, how things will go. By waste of time I meant something like this :) Yeah, actually it's one of most used ID templates at enwiki and probably the most used template, which don't have property here. --Edgars2007 (talk) 07:48, 5 March 2016 (UTC) Merge problems Can someone merge de:Kategorie:Hochschullehrer nach Staat (Q8975789) with en:Category:academics by nationality (Q7004720) ? 92.76.107.255 22:28, 4 March 2016 (UTC) Seems to me that these shouldn't be merged, with a couple of language conflicts. To me it seems however that several links of Category:Academics by nationality (Q7004720) should be moved to Category:University teachers by country (Q8975789). But my limitations of language knowledge may mislead me here.

We're starting m:Wikimedia CEE Spring 2016 soon and currently local chapters are preparing lists of vital articles we would love to see written in other languages. Here's a sample list for Poland, as you can see manually adding new entries is a major pain as one would have to check whether certain article exists in one of the 26 languages, then manually add the links, format the table…So, I was wondering if this could be done by a template. The template would include all the formatting, all the user would have to do is to fill in the Wikidata Q code for all the links to load (or a – sign to load if there is no article), and then subst the template in place to form a new line in the table. How do I retrieve names and links to articles, and a minus sign if there is no article? Halibutt (talk) 01:41, 3 March 2016 (UTC) @Halibutt:, is this template+module is suitable for you? --Voll (talk) 16:56, 5 March 2016 (UTC) @Voll: Yup, that's precisely what I was trying to achieve.

Funded by donors. Tony1 (talk) 06:42, 4 March 2016 (UTC) I think you're mistaken. While in Sydney I ran one workshop - at the State Library, who hosted the event and, I understand, provided the venue for free. It was so well attended that extra chairs had to be brought in from adjacent rooms. I also had the meeting which resulted in the above-mentioned article being written. There was a social meetup, in a cafe, and it was indeed a pity that, despite the best efforts of WikimediaAU volunteers to set up and publicise the event, no-one other than me and the organisers turned up. Perhaps it's that you're thinking of. I'm not sure what the total expense for the social event was, but there was no venue hire and no pre-ordered catering, so it would be minimal, if any. Fortunately, every other event on the three-week tour - talks, workshops and social meets where I was available to answer Wikipedians questions about Wikidata and my GLAM work - was also well attended, and well received. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 11:26, 7 March 2016 (UTC) What's the correct property for the building of an institution I'm trying to figure out what is the right way to enter the information relating to the building which houses an institution. Ex .: the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (Q861252) is inside Palau Nacional (Q2341107) or Louvre Museum (Q19675) is in Louvre Palace (Q1075988). My questions are: What is the most suitable property?. It could be headquarters location (P159) as in previous two examples, but its description says it should be a location, ie an element geographical, not a building (or similar). In fact, most examples of museum (Q33506) have a geographical place (city, street,..) in headquarters location (P159). Another option could be the location (P276), but is designed for institutions, whose elements/items (as a Mona Lisa (Q12418)) are inside the institution / location. In the event that the building has no separate personality from the museum itself (ie. British Museum (Q6373), which should accommodate the data of the building (sizes, date of construction, architect, etc.)? Thanks, --Amadalvarez (talk) 15:07, 26 February 2016 (UTC) I thought we are using location (P276)=building for this. --- Jura 12:48, 27 February 2016 (UTC) Mmmm. Sorry, but I see now that location (P276)=building (Q41176) is in the list of Wikidata:Database reports/Constraint violations/P276. Funny property. In the examples display Mona Lisa (Q12418) is inside Louvre Museum (Q19675) and, in constraint violations, the \"museums\" appear as forbidden !!. Some help ?.--Amadalvarez (talk) 17:29, 28 February 2016 (UTC) I also use location (P276)=building for this. Maybe constraint should be removed? If another property is not available. Michiel1972 (talk) 11:54, 4 March 2016 (UTC) When Amadalvarez commented, one of the constraints needed fixing. This has been done since then. --- Jura 12 01, 4 March 2016 (UTC) Thanks to everybody. I will use location (P276) and change when I found any wrong use of any other propertry, as in Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (Q861252) or Louvre Museum (Q19675), for instance,. --Amadalvarez (talk) 09:00, 7 March 2016 (UTC) Property proposals need attention There are many proposals for property that have been sitting for months waiting for comments (favourable or otherwise) and/or attention from property creators. Transportation, Unsorted, Generic and Natural Science categories seem to me (subjectively) to be the slowest moving ones. If we are to move the project forwards we need to respond to proposals for properties when people make them - one of the best ways to demotivate people is to ignore them. Thryduulf (talk: local | en.wp | en.wikt) 19:30, 28 February 2016 (UTC) The problem is that there are several people requesting properties without actually using them. Now we have to do maintenance on a lot of them before they were even used: Wikidata:Project_chat#Dormant_properties. Don't hesitate to ask an administrator or a property creator to look into specific proposals, if you plan to use them. Maybe not for external identifiers, as we have not sorted these out yet. --- Jura 17:51, 29 February 2016 (UTC) Well if proposals were not left lingering for months before being created then more of them would be used quicker (but see my comments elsewhere for why I disagree that dormant properties are actually as big an issue as it is claimed). For example at WD:PP/EVENT there are proposals that I've just marked as ready that have been sat with unanimous support since November, and a property I proposed in January has attracted no comments favourable or otherwise. At Wikidata:Property proposal/Transportation there have been properties marked ready for almost two weeks with no action. I've tried pinging people to follow up comments they left several months ago without any response. I've tried pinging various property creators (on and off wikidata) previously with no response.
