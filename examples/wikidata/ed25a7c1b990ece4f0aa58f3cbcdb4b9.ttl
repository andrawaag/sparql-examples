 Try it! This tells me if Tomorrow Is Yesterday (Q5252917) has the English title \"Tomorrow Is Yesterday\". But I don't care for the language. I want to find any identical string. Just removing the @en suffix, won't yield any results. --Shisma (talk) 07:45, 4 July 2021 (UTC)I've found the answer myself: SELECT ?stmt WHERE {

I need the following metadata:NAMES, BIRTHDATES, BIRTHPLACES, GENDERTo download this metadata I do this:`Select ?term ?member ?memberLabel ?dateBirth ?dateBirthLabel ?placeBirth ?placeBirthLabel ?sex ?sexLabel Where { # Get all CD members

 } But now I need to add the fact that members of parliament work in different terms (legislatures), which begin and end at different dates. In each legislature, they may belong to different political parties. Maybe the easiest is to download all members of parliament for a particular legislature \"X\" (beginning at a particular date, and ending at a particular date), In this legislature the member of parliament belongs to a political party. But I am totally INCAPABLE of doing this.Could anybody help?Best--Mcptrad (talk) 20:38, 10 July 2021 (UTC) @Mcptrad: In essence, you're asking about how to get at statement qualifiers, and the answer is somewhat like this. (I've also made lots of stuff optional, since you may not have DoB and PoB, for instance. Nor am I familiar with Spanish political seat P39 statements, so some of my choices more reflect the UK way of doing things, but yuo can see the pattern & can adjust it to suit Spain.) See also https://wdqs-tutorial.toolforge.org/index.php/category/simple-queries/qualifiers/ You'll get multiple rows for a single individual who has multiple qualifying P39 statements, so there's another job, possibly, of aggregating the data. But one thing at once. Select ?member ?memberLabel ?dateBirth ?placeBirthLabel ?sexLabel ?electoral_districtLabel ?start ?end ?parliamentary_groupLabel ?parliamentary_termLabel Where {

I'm not sure what is causing this. That's a problem far from my skills to resolve. I have followed the DOI of these items and added the journal article's title to the item's label and title, but there are so many. I'm not even sure one couldn't create yet another item with that DOI using SourceMD (resulting in another item to fix). Example, Q58391055 is such an item.Can someone create a list for me that has the QID and the DOI (as a link, preferably) for those items with DOI (P356) that start with 10.1023/A: without a Label or a title (P1476), I can create a table to generate a correction through QuickStatement.If anyone can prevent this from continuing to happen, it would be nice to think there's a list that I can correct and it won't continue to add new items without a title.

If you limited to items that are scholarly articles, that might limit some. Did you limit to a specific journal because otherwise it times out? Thanks again, I can address these pretty quickly now so thank you so much. Trilotat (talk) 16:05, 4 July 2021 (UTC) @Jura1: A follow-up... This is working better than expected!
