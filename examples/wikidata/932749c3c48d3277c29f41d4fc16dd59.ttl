There might be a few other tweaks that could be done, notably for title (P1476). --- Jura 16:15, 19 January 2017 (UTC) Film descriptions in ['es', 'ca', 'gl', 'ast', 'an', 'ext', 'oc', 'it', 'pt', 'sv', 'de', 'nl', 'fr', 'he', ] Good news, I just noticed that Emijrp's Emijrpbot (talk • contribs • logs) adds descriptions to film items! The details are in film.descriptions.py.Personally, I added them in English once in a while. I try to follow the sample at WikiProject_Movies/Properties#Description, but skip any films that don't have both director and year. I also skip films with many directors, these are generally anthology films. --- Jura 07:52, 5 March 2017 (UTC) The Bot is blocked now due too high editing rate. Queryzo (talk) 08:45, 5 March 2017 (UTC) Yeah I noticed, but that's mainly a problem with the website and should eventually be sorted out. --- Jura 08:47, 5 March 2017 (UTC) Some time ago I added a lot of Italian description, now I use quickstatments and this Listeria list that I elaborate with a spreadsheet. --ValterVB (talk) 17:14, 5 March 2017 (UTC) Hello! Bot is unblocked now. I am open to add more languages to the script (the latest language added is Arabic). Your help is appreciated. Emijrp (talk) 14:54, 11 March 2017 (UTC)@Emijrp: Would Hungarian be too much of a stretch? If we were to use the same data, the others use, it would look like this: \"[Hungarian label of director] [year][suffix] filmje\". The language of the label is important when the director's name is originally in a non-Latin script, because Hungarian often uses its own transliteration, but it also cannot be omitted, because without the name the rest of the description won't make sense as \"filmje\" means \"film of/by\" so without the name it should only be \"film\". The suffix is always necessary but depends on the number. Thankfully, all numbers will be four digit, which simplifies the process: if the last digit is 1, 2, 4, 7 or 9, the suffix is \"-es\" (e.g. \"2011-es\"), if the last digit is 3 or 8, it is \"-as\" (\"1988-as\"), if the last digit is 5, it is \"-ös\" (\"1995-ös\"), if the last digit is 6, it is \"-os\" (\"1936-os\"), if the last digit is 0, you check the digit before that: if the last two digits are 10, 40, 50 or 70, it is \"-es\" (\"2010-es\"), if the last two digits are 20, 30, 60 or 80, it is \"-as\" (\"1960-as\"), if the last two digits are 00, you check the digit before that: if the last three digits are 100, 200, … 900, it is \"-as\" (\"1900-as\", really there cannot be any other as of now) if the last three digits are 000, since the maximum year is below ten thousand, it is \"-es\" (\"2000-es\", yet again, the only option). How do you like it? So a complete example would be \"Barry Jenkins 2016-os filmje\". :) (See also function 'hanyas' in hu:Modul:Nyelvtani modul.) – Máté (talk) 18:03, 11 March 2017 (UTC) Property for film script(s) Should we create a new property to link items about film scripts? This could be an item about an online version, a published version in book form, or the specific copy held by a museum or an archive. --- Jura 15:32, 12 March 2017 (UTC) Here it is: Wikidata:Property proposal/film script. --- Jura 06:09, 15 March 2017 (UTC) In the meantime, this was created as film script (P3816) and I made an initial list, mainly based on images at Commons: Wikidata:WikiProject Movies/lists/scripts. --- Jura 06:19, 28 March 2017 (UTC) Property for key film scenes? How could we integrate details on specific film scenes? --- Jura 09:17, 25 March 2017 (UTC) You can simply connect them with the part of (P361)/has part(s) (P527) properties, can't you? – Máté (talk) 11:34, 25 March 2017 (UTC) I don't know. Do you? --- Jura 11:36, 25 March 2017 (UTC) I agree with Maté. Here is an example for Dumbo's Pink Elephants on Parade-Scene: Pink Elephants on Parade (Q29021559). But maybe you have other details in mind?--Valentina.Anitnelav (talk) 11:44, 25 March 2017 (UTC) The item you just created looks good. It's even more developed than I had imagined. Currently we only have few similar ones (4): SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?itemDescription

}
 Try it! None seems to be using has part(s) (P527) leaving these somewhat lost. Anthology films use P527 to link their parts. --- Jura 13:35, 25 March 2017 (UTC) Here is a list of anthology films currently using P527: Wikidata:WikiProject Movies/lists/anthology films. Shall we create a new property for scenes? --- Jura 03:50, 11 April 2017 (UTC) I have no strong opinion here, as I see no real advantage/disadvantage in retrieving information. Maybe it would be more intuitive and thus encouraging to add scenes if there is an own property. -- Valentina.Anitnelav (talk) 09:56, 14 April 2017 (UTC) Gaps == Active users == ValterVB LydiaPintscher Ermanon Mushroom Queryzo Danrok Rogi Mbch331 Jobu0101 putnik AmaryllisGardener Andreasmperu U+1F350 Bodhisattwa Shisma Wolverène Tris T7 Antoine2711 CptViraj ʂɤɲ Trivialist 2le2im-bdc Sotiale Wallacegromit1, mostly focus on media historiography and works from the Global South M2k~dewiki Rockpeterson Mathieu Kappler Sidohayder Spinster Gnoeee Ranjithsiji Ontogon Supaplex Carlinmack Haseeb Demadrend Jakeob9000 RealityBites Sriveenkat Keplersj dseomn Fuzheado BeLucky DaxServer PaperHuman JerimeeNotified participants of WikiProject MoviesObviously we don't cover every single (e.g.) British film nor include an item about every TV series episode. Also we have a quite a lot of property to describe these, but most items are far from complete.Besides that, I was wondering where you think we have substantial gaps (properties or items). At some point, I noticed that enwiki keeps deleting articles about Indian actors, but I don't think these were covered in other languages either. Maybe our coverage of (e.g.) Indian cinema could need improvement. --- Jura 06:32, 31 March 2017 (UTC) First of all we need to be sure, how many items we got about TV series episodes for example. This query is a good tool to add IMDb IDs on single series. Queryzo (talk) 12:49, 31 March 2017 (UTC) Here is a query that gives some measure about TV episode items. Comparison with other websites is another way to do it, but I'm more curious about perceived gaps \"besides that\". e.g. Nigerian cinema is said to be very prolific, but [1] finds only 152 today. The two previous topics above address other gaps. --- Jura 08:25, 2 April 2017 (UTC) On Multichills disk page, we have created a new query using number of episodes (P1113) to get a list of the series with most missing IMDb IDs or items. So there's the question f.e. if we want to have all episodes of The Bill (Q929589) in Wikidata (2412 items). Queryzo (talk) 15:08, 23 April 2017 (UTC) For some series, enwiki has episode summaries in lists. It would be great if we could somehow get to retrieve these with the items if we create them. Otherwise the items are just a list of episode title translations (at least, until you split them by language). --- Jura 04:50, 1 May 2017 (UTC) Festivals and its award(s) Items used: film festival (Q220505)   Properties used: instance of (P31)   , has part(s) of the class (P2670)   SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?award ?awardLabel

I'm a bit hesitant to create these systematically.For the current year, the items would have the advantage that one could easily list the upcoming dates. This would be more precise than the Wikidata:WikiProject Movies/lists/film festivals this month.Obviously, it would be tedious to create these items manually, so some sort of bot would be good. --- Jura 16:24, 4 June 2017 (UTC) Language of film == Active users == ValterVB LydiaPintscher Ermanon Mushroom Queryzo Danrok Rogi Mbch331 Jobu0101 putnik AmaryllisGardener Andreasmperu U+1F350 Bodhisattwa Shisma Wolverène Tris T7 Antoine2711 CptViraj ʂɤɲ Trivialist 2le2im-bdc Sotiale Wallacegromit1, mostly focus on media historiography and works from the Global South M2k~dewiki Rockpeterson Mathieu Kappler Sidohayder Spinster Gnoeee Ranjithsiji Ontogon Supaplex Carlinmack Haseeb Demadrend Jakeob9000 RealityBites Sriveenkat Keplersj dseomn Fuzheado BeLucky DaxServer PaperHuman JerimeeNotified participants of WikiProject MoviesCurrently we have original language of film or TV show (P364) to describe the original language of a film and language of work or name (P407) for any additional languages voice is available.

Oppose the the deletion or attempt to use a new property? Let things merge and then hope someone will eventually fix it? --- Jura 16:56, 26 February 2017 (UTC) As IMDb is not seperating them, I don't see why we should. Queryzo (talk) 17:02, 26 February 2017 (UTC) Not sure if it matters who does what. The question is how we want to proceed and why. I do think the original language of a film should be easily retrievable and not mixed with the information that a Russian version made available as well. --- Jura 17:28, 26 February 2017 (UTC) I agree with Jura. The original language of a film has to be easily retrievable and not mixed with other information. --Jobu0101 (talk) 18:10, 26 February 2017 (UTC) I think we should only claim the languages present in the original using original language of film or TV show (P364). Claiming the language for dubbed versions seems a bit problematic to me. Danrok (talk) 18:24, 26 February 2017 (UTC) Please do participate in deletion discussion. Property deletion reuests are often based on narrow segment of property usage and/or ingnorig its real usage in wikis. I do not think that \"separate item for each dubbing\" approach will be ever popular at movie items (at the moment less than 100 dubbing items vs. 224 000 film items), so keeping both original language of film or TV show (P364) language of work or name (P407) seems important to me. --Jklamo (talk) 20:48, 26 February 2017 (UTC) Why you're talking about dubbed versions? The IMDb gives Russian, German, an English, when these three languages are in the original film, so there are all original language of film or TV show (P364). Queryzo (talk) 20:56, 26 February 2017 (UTC) I think you are referring to a different question. language of work or name (P407) can list all languages in which film was translated (\"dubbed\"), e.g. an English language film into Russian, German, Spanish, French, etc. The question is now if we should just move films to separate properties or vote to keep the existing ones. --- Jura 05:07, 28 February 2017 (UTC) An alternative could be to just let original language of film or TV show (P364) be deleted and see if it gets sorted out/how much it deteriorates. In the meantime, obviously, I couldn't set the title any more. --- Jura 06:50, 12 March 2017 (UTC) == Active users == ValterVB LydiaPintscher Ermanon Mushroom Queryzo Danrok Rogi Mbch331 Jobu0101 putnik AmaryllisGardener Andreasmperu U+1F350 Bodhisattwa Shisma Wolverène Tris T7 Antoine2711 CptViraj ʂɤɲ Trivialist 2le2im-bdc Sotiale Wallacegromit1, mostly focus on media historiography and works from the Global South M2k~dewiki Rockpeterson Mathieu Kappler Sidohayder Spinster Gnoeee Ranjithsiji Ontogon Supaplex Carlinmack Haseeb Demadrend Jakeob9000 RealityBites Sriveenkat Keplersj dseomn Fuzheado BeLucky DaxServer PaperHuman JerimeeNotified participants of WikiProject MoviesLooks like the various properties will be merged.

Except a few video installations, all films that are only in cawiki have been covered. I noticed that a few directors had categories for films made by them, but no actual items.

For others, it suggests the use of Duplicity (Q23751912). With Petscan, I add original language of film as well. Based on this, eventually title gets added. Others add more information.Now, if I'd do the same for English language films from some other Wikipedia, this is likely to create a duplicate, as the title of the Wikipedia may not be the same. Still, eventually, the original title might get added and we end up merging the duplicates. A good approach for these could be to search directly for duplicates, but this isn't that convenient, as Duplicity doesn't automatically retrieve the original title.Once in a while, some flooding user/bot creates tons of new items and we tend to end up with many duplicates anyways.I wonder how should proceed going forward: 1. should we just keep creating items for films and do at least some checking for duplicates: as Petscan does, at least for enwiki. 2. create items for new films every couple of days 3. proceed with (2.), but exclude wikis like nlwiki that routinely follow new articles and attempt to link existing items. 4. some other solution .. What do you think? --- Jura 07:35, 3 September 2017 (UTC) Difficult one. We want as little duplicates as possible. Whatever solution is chosen, please exclude nlwiki.

This was consistent with Wikidata:WikiProject_Movies/Properties#Episode.You might recall the discussion on Property talk:P1191 after which the description of the property was update to specify \"live-broadcast\" and publication date (P577) was added at Wikidata:WikiProject_Movies/Properties#Episode.Unfortunately, P1191 wasn't removed and still shows a sample for the Simpsons. Besides, most episodes used P1191. I don't think there are any live-broadcasted ones included in these series.The question is if we should change all episodes to P577 (and remove P1191 in the sample) or keep using P1191. What's your opinion? --- Jura 13:09, 12 March 2018 (UTC) I'd say use date of first performance (P1191) for live performances and live broadcasts, and use publication date (P577) prerecorded episodes/shows. However, there are odd situations: TV shows billed as being live, but are not really live, e.g. some chat shows are prerecorded earlier in the day that they're broadcast on, in front of live audiences. I'd say that these are not live shows, so use publication date (P577). Movie premieres at film festivals. This is where a film is shown for the first time on one screen only, and is the movie world equivalent of a theatrical premiere. To further confuse things some movies have several so-called premieres. These can be at cinemas as well.

There are also a few incomplete ones, e.g. Q2701332, that lacks an indication of the season. For now, I will try to fix the incomplete ones based on eswiki titles and remove \"Anexo:\".

One could create a new item \"main character\" or \"regular character\" that includes the protagonist, the main supporting characters, etc. (so roughly all characters featured in the opening credits) and apply the same approach to them. Then one could take the union of main characters and recurring characters. On which level would one mark the characters as recurring/main character of a series; series or season (to call some character a recurring character in relation to an episode doesn't make much sense)? A list of characters for the whole series can be quite extensive, so it seems to be better to list them for each season. A character being a main/recurring character in at least one season could be considered also a main/recurring character for the series. But what about characters that have guest appearances in several seasons that sum up to a recurring character for the whole series? - Valentina.Anitnelav (talk) 11:40, 23 March 2018 (UTC) Interesting thoughts. Yes, \"main character\" would probably work better. P1114 might not be needed and one could just set some P2670 once these are identified. The optimal level might depending on the series as well. I went ahead and created \"main character\" (Q50937280). I revised the description of \"protagonist\" slightly (Q215972). Use at Q19863017#P674. --- Jura 17:23, 25 March 2018 (UTC) TV seasons lacking series Another report: Wikidata:WikiProject Movies/reports/TV seasons/without series --- Jura 07:05, 25 March 2018 (UTC) The same for episodes lacking seasons is at Wikidata:Database_reports/Complex_constraint_violations/P4908#Episodes_generally_have_this_property. --- Jura 05:43, 26 March 2018 (UTC) First episodes A list at Wikidata:WikiProject Movies/lists/TV episodes/first. --- Jura 09:35, 19 March 2018 (UTC)I added all pilot episodes in there too. --- Jura 10:32, 27 March 2018 (UTC) Television series sitelinks Some episode items include Wikiapedia sitelinks with \"described at URL\". Sample: Q2004297#P973. I'm not sure if there would be another property to do that. --- Jura 12:48, 24 March 2018 (UTC) Well, it's not really a Wikipedia sitelink, but a link to another Wiki hosted at Fandom (Q17459). Using described at URL (P973) statements for that isn't a problem, Memory Alpha (Q498824) is actually a good source for information about Star Trek. Though I'm not sure such statements should be used systematically on all Star Trek items, and certainly not for every random fan wiki. Maybe dedicated properties for a few big fan wikis like Memory Alpha (Q498824) or Wookieepedia (Q934052) might be quite useful. --Kam Solusar (talk) 13:26, 26 March 2018 (UTC) Wikia-pedia ;) In general, I think they compare fairly well to every other identifier on episode items. Obviously, I guess they could be empty, but I haven't come across that yet. P3417 seem to link unrelated pages. I'm not sure if one for each Wikiapedia would be good, but one that fits any of them might work. Not sure if there could be several on a given episode. --- Jura 10:32, 27 March 2018 (UTC) Name of fictional human How to manage the name of fictional human? Example in The Nanny (Q464865) the name of Fran Fine was \"translated\" in \"Francesca Cacace\" the item about the character have given name (P735) = Fran (Q1469911) but for an italian reader isn't correct.

To avoid massive inverse constraint violations (XYZ should also have the inverse statement, which is not suitable for seasons with a lot of episodes) and get clear with double episodes, which also are stated with has part(s) (P527)/part of (P361), we should strongly think about an own property \"season\".

I totally agree, we need spececific properties for a better description. Escudero (talk) 12:08, 18 February 2018 (UTC) Can you explain why you feel part of/has part \"is not suitable for seasons with a lot of episodes\"? Danrok (talk) 19:30, 18 February 2018 (UTC) This would mean, that f.e. The Bill, series 5 (Q7717975) should have 104 items in has part(s) (P527), normal seasons have up to 22 episodes. This is no useful task and it is not good database modelling. Queryzo (talk) 22:07, 18 February 2018 (UTC) I've stumbled upon this too when cleaning up constraint violations. I think a separate property here makes sense. --LydiaPintscher (talk) 19:34, 23 February 2018 (UTC) @Queryzo: That's not necessarily a good reason. Why? Because we do not have items for each episode of The Bill. Until we do, then the problem doesn't exist. Which begs the question should we be creating an item for every TV episode ever made? If so, who will be doing all that work? Danrok (talk) 00:37, 25 February 2018 (UTC) This is not the point, every episode can have an item, we do this per bot and hand, but: adding dozen of reverse relations to fullfill the constraints of part of (P361) is not useful, this was mainly made for 1:n relations, where n is between 2 and 5. Queryzo (talk) 07:51, 25 February 2018 (UTC) @Escudero, Danrok, LydiaPintscher: I now added Wikidata:Property proposal/Creative work#Season. Queryzo (talk) 21:47, 24 February 2018 (UTC) As season (P4908) was created, we now should move all statements part of (P361) / part of the series (P179) with items of type television series season (Q3464665) to the new property. @Pasleim: Could you do this? Queryzo (talk) 08:30, 5 March 2018 (UTC) KrBot should do it in a couple of days. --- Jura 08:39, 5 March 2018 (UTC) Looks like Edgars2007 has done most of it already. To fix these items, maybe date of first performance (P1191) could be moved to publication date (P577) as well. --- Jura 15:00, 7 March 2018 (UTC) Though it seems not only those part-of statements regarding seasons were moved to season statements. In A Voice in the Wilderness: Part 1 (Q48668572) and A Voice in the Wilderness: Part 2 (Q48668741), the statements indcating that those episodes are part of a two-part episode (Q21664088) were also erroneously moved. --Kam Solusar (talk) 20:34, 7 March 2018 (UTC) There are few indeed. The query for the single value constraint on the property talk page lists them. --- Jura 01:31, 8 March 2018 (UTC) And for seasons should we still use part of the series (P179) or part of (P361) (of the series itself)? --Infovarius (talk) 12:37, 6 March 2018 (UTC)For the record, I used this queryselect distinct ?item {  ?item wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q21191270 .

Although I suspect there are more two-parters out there that simply don't have the correct two-part episode (Q21664088) statement yet, since Wikipedias often treat them as a single episodes. --Kam Solusar (talk) 12:44, 26 March 2018 (UTC) Yes. It might be true that the only two-part episodes included are those of the series listed. These are generally fairly complete. For added fun, there are also segment of a television episode (Q29555881) and three-part episode (Q50062923). --- Jura 10:32, 27 March 2018 (UTC)How would we deal with missing parent episodes for two-parters like The One with Two Parts, Part One (Q12339080) / The One with Two Parts, Part Two (Q12339082)? There's no counter-part in the English Wikipedia. Should we just create a new parent episode?--37.201.30.50 15:32, 4 April 2018 (UTC) Yes, this would be fine. Queryzo (talk) 18:04, 4 April 2018 (UTC) I've now created The One with Two Parts (Q51438598) and linked back to it from its two parts with \"part of\". I've explicitly set IMDb to \"no value\". I've tried to duplicate as little information as possible, after all, that is all in the two existing items. Can anyone look at those three articles and give some feedback? Thanks.--37.201.30.50 08:27, 5 April 2018 (UTC) In general, I wouldn't create them unless there is some additional information to add (e.g. identifier, Wikipedia sitelink, details on story arc). --- Jura 11:07, 7 April 2018 (UTC) Even more fun with cross-overs: https://tools.wmflabs.org/reasonator/?q=Q40911314&lang=en (between 4 series). --- Jura 14:41, 7 April 2018 (UTC) P17 --> P495 can we build an autofix pattern for moving this into P495?

Queryzo (talk) 06:55, 6 April 2018 (UTC) Those cases should probably looked at individually to sort them out. It Might be a good idea in general to run a query to see which movies have countries set as country of origin (P495) that have start dates later than the movie's publication date. It's unfortunately quite a widespread problem on Wikidata that items of current countries are often used for persons/things that existed or started prior to their foundation (Germany is one such widerspread case, as Germany (Q183) is supposed to only cover the FRG from 1949 on). --Kam Solusar (talk) 07:54, 6 April 2018 (UTC) I'm not sure if \"country of origin\" is necessarily the one.

I think we either need a new property or remove \"actor\" from the description of cast member. (Edit wrt. to \"participant\": there's a property \"object has role\". Can anyone name one? Guest is correct, but there are people who talk with the host, muscial guests, stand-up comedians, and so on. In a political talk show it could be panelist or debater.)--37.201.30.50 09:49, 5 April 2018 (UTC) Yeah, cast member (P161) doesn't seem to be a great solution for non-actors appearing on film/television, like guests on talk shows or interviews and footage of people in documentaries, etc... You could use character role (P453) self (Q18086706) as a qualifier, but that doesn't really distinguish between people simply appearing as themselves and actors playing fictionalized versions of themselves. --Kam Solusar (talk) 09:59, 5 April 2018 (UTC) Please see Wikidata:Property_proposal/talk_show_guest. --- Jura 11:07, 7 April 2018 (UTC) It's now at talk show guest (P5030).

I'm not a specialist (I work more often on books in Wikidata), but if I understand correctly, there is right now 2 concurrent methods : based on (P144) = origin work item genre (P136) = film adaptation (Q1257444) The first method is more common. On 266 493 item on movies (and subclasses) movies, 7 077 have a based on (P144) but only 3 793 items have genre (P136) = film adaptation (Q1257444). The first method is alos more explicit (it says \"this is adapted from this particular work\" while the second one only says \"it adapted from something\"). This method is also more simple and direct.My point of view, is that we should *only* stick to the first method which seems to me « necessary and sufficient » to model reality (while the second is not necessary nor sufficient). Plus, the second one raised some other problems (see recent discussions with MovieFex, El Caro and Archimëa, about the question of the use - or not - of film adaptation (Q1257444) for films adapted from video games) and I even wonder if film adaptation (Q1257444) is really a film genre (Q201658) (is there any references for this? as an amateur, it feels more like a technic or a process than a genre).All together, I'm proposing to remove all the genre (P136) = film adaptation (Q1257444) (obviously, after carefull check that the based on (P144) is already here so we don't loose information). And to write it somewhere (maybe Wikidata:WikiProject Movies/Properties?).What do you think?Cdlt, VIGNERON (talk) 09:12, 24 April 2018 (UTC) In my opinion, film adaptation (Q1257444) is not a genre. In general, I think we have too many genres, and if anything it is unhelpful. There are no accepted standards regarding film genres, so it is somewhat vague. My view is we should go about this the same way as professionals do, and stick to the main genres, drama, thriller, action, horror, etc. and define more specific claims using well defined properties. Take a look at Genres: where to draw the line? Danrok (talk) 15:31, 24 April 2018 (UTC) ⟨ film adaptation (Q1257444)    ⟩ instance of (P31) ⟨ film genre (Q201658)    ⟩ is a side problem for me here (the cherry on the cake) but still can someone provide references to sort this out? Looking at the histroy, I see it has been added by DavidMar86hdf in 2014 (when there was already a subclass of (P279)...), then removed by Andreasmperu, then added again by Michiel1972 in 2015 (and everything without references nor explanation that I can see, and there has been a lot of changes on other values for P31 and P279...). Cdlt, VIGNERON (talk) 18:01, 24 April 2018 (UTC) I also noticed that english description of film adaptation (Q1257444) looks like to encompass every kind of works, not only books. The general category (wich includes books, video games, comics...) topic's main category (P910) = Category:Films based on works (Q8126463) linked to film adaptation (Q1257444) confirms imo this statement. But in other languages, film adaptation (Q1257444) is restricted for books adapattion ONLY (example is de.wiki and es.wiki...). MovieFex who mainly contributes at Wikipedia in German might have modified this for this reason. @Danrok: I agree with you. Only the main genres should be added. I think, some misunderstand \"genre at Wikidata\" and \"Wikipedia category\". Look at this exemple below. There are realy a lot of genres, redundant, sometimes silly. There is even not a single page that do not need to be modified. '( Who could correct all this ?
