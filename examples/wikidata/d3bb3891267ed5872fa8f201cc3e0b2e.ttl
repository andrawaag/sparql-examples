In risk engineering, a very simplisitic way to estimate the frequency of accidents in tunnels could be to estimate the following ratio (for a given geographical zone) (kilometers of roads in tunnel) / (overall kilometers of roads).

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 19:28, 3 February 2020 (UTC) Hello @Tagishsimon: and thank you for your answer, but this is not what I am looking for. Both your suggestions are about finding the newest information, while my query is designed to work with historical data. I am not trying to find the current value, but the right one at the time I'm studying. When a commune changes its INSEE code after 2017, I still need to find it under the code it had in 2017. Conversely, when I use this query to get the list of communes in 1966, I expect Avernes (Q55589867) to show up with its INSEE code from that time. Regards, Arpyia (talk) 20:54, 3 February 2020 (UTC) Sorry about that. Probably something like the query below (though there are probably many ways of doing much the same). I do think that the current value for INSEE in Avernes (Q55589867) should be preferred rank; it is the current truthy value & that's why we have rank. So I'm sorry to see you have changed it back.

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 21:59, 3 February 2020 (UTC) Hello @Tagishsimon:, and thank you again for your research. This is going in the direction I was hoping for. There are still issues, because there should be a way to find more precise data, i.e. find information for each day instead of for the whole year. Anyway, this new query returns different and unexpected errors, so I need to investigate the data again. Regards, Arpyia (talk) 20:00, 4 February 2020 (UTC) It is easy to change the code to use day precision instead of year. The variables ?startdate and ?enddate isn't necessary and the date filters can be changed to: filter (!bound(?start) || ?start <= ?dateRecherche)
filter (!bound(?end) || ?end >= ?dateRecherche)
 Ideally you might want to also add a test for the precision of the date values. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 20:53, 4 February 2020 (UTC) Hello @Tagishsimon: and @Dipsacus fullonum:, I think this is working!

 Try it! Above is version 2. I moved the API access to a subquery and tried to get links to the articles. Currently the subquery gives 3 results, so I am surprised that getting ?article_en and ?article_it takes long time. With both outcommented as above, the whole query takes about 1 second. But if I try to get ?article_it, it takes 50 seconds. And If I try to get ?article_en, it times out. Can anyone explain, or even better fix, that? --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) I found the answer myself. It was (of course) that the engine tried to get all articles before running the subquery, and the solution is to change it to a named subquery which will run first. Version 3 is below.

Whether information obtained in this way is then (re)usable is left as a topic for discussion. But it's certainly a nice SPARQL demo exercise. Jheald (talk) 22:14, 6 February 2020 (UTC) Alternatively one could gather up the shapefiles (eg from [1]), and then see which nearby constituencies have boundaries that share common nodes. Jheald (talk) 22:19, 6 February 2020 (UTC) @Pigsonthewing: Maybe a bit \"off topic\", but the set of constituency of the House of Commons (Q27971968) seems to be in need for some care before any query related to geography could be really meaningful: A lot of suspected duplicates (said to be the same as (P460)) exist located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) is missing for a lot of objects coordinate location (P625) is missing for most objects geoshape (P3896) is missing for all objects shares border with (P47) is missing for all but ten objects (and maybe incomplete also for those ten) For details refer to this query: SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?located_inLabel ?coord ?geoshape (GROUP_CONCAT(?adjacent_to_label;SEPARATOR=', ') AS ?adjacents) ?said_to_be_same_as ?said_to_be_same_asLabel WHERE

Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 10:01, 7 February 2020 (UTC) I left the ball in Andrew's court - User talk:Andrew Gray#Constituency snafu? although I'm not sure at this distance what I was wittering on about. Looks complicated and HMMV. --Tagishsimon (talk) 10:10, 7 February 2020 (UTC) I've started documenting this at Wikidata:WikiProject British Politicians/Constituencies, and its talk page. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 10:15, 7 February 2020 (UTC) @Larske, Tagishsimon, Pigsonthewing: Yes, there's definitely a lot of work needing doing here, and I haven't had as much time to work on it as I'd hoped. The said to be the same as (P460) links are a bit of a problem - we don't have a clear property to describe what I want to say, which is \"these are meaningfully different things with the same name, which are often treated as all being the same thing\". We definitely want to keep them seperated, so please don't merge - at the moment there is one item for each distinct start/end, plus for substantial changes like a switch in the number of MPs. P131 and so on are all on my \"do in the fullness of time\" list, but there are some thorny problems yet to figure out - most of the UK admin areas have changed substantially over time so it's not always clear quite what parent areas we should use for P131. (eg all the modern constituencies are mapped into regions - do we want to keep this approach for historic constituencies that pre-date the official regions) Geoshapes are desirable but I have held off adding them due to concerns about copyright - my understanding was always that we need these to be CC-0 to go on Commons, though from a chat with @Jheald: recently it seems we might have found a workaround for this, in which case we can import. Finally, for \"adjacent\" - to be honest, this is something I'd never even thought of trying to model! Can't hurt to do it as suggested, though. Andrew Gray (talk) 10:46, 7 February 2020 (UTC) @Andrew Gray: Some comments: The use of said to be the same as (P460) is just an early signal that the item could/should be merged! If you have two (or more) different objects, Qn and Qm, that should be kept apart although they might have the same name and thus becomes mixed up, I think you should add the property different from (P1889) to both of them, i.e. Qn different from (P1889) Qm and Qm different from (P1889) Qn. That will tell others not to merge them. You may also want to change the instance of (P31), like from \"X\" to \"former X\", to make the differenct more obvious. If the located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) has varied over time, you can use several located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)-statements, each with a relevant start time (P580) and/or end time (P582) as qualifier. As at most one of the located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)-statements should lack a end time (P582) qualifier, the current value could be found by SPARQL filtering for that, i.e. ignore all statements with a end time (P582) qualifier. The same could be applied also for number of seats in assembly (P1410) and other properties that varies over time. --Larske (talk) 13:43, 7 February 2020 (UTC) \"an early signal that the item could/should be merged\" That's certainly not my understanding of its meaning, nor is it supported by the property's description (at least in English), or its creation proposal. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 20:17, 7 February 2020 (UTC) @Pigsonthewing: Sorry, I missed the disputed part that I now see is part of the English description. The property said to be the same as (P460) doesn't have a Swedish description, just the label. But even if it is not a \"signal for merging\", I still think it would be good if this property could be avoided in case the object should be considered as \"not the same\". That's why I suggested that different from (P1889) should be used instead. --Larske (talk) 01:11, 8 February 2020 (UTC) @Larske: Thanks - I'll get them all switched to \"different from\". I'm reluctant to use different P31s, though, as really this should be clear from the dates. Andrew Gray (talk) 23:16, 7 February 2020 (UTC) @Larske: Running a switch to \"different from\" now (should be done and through to the query service in a couple of hours). Thanks for the advice :-) Andrew Gray (talk) 17:06, 8 February 2020 (UTC) @Jheald, Larske, Tagishsimon, Pigsonthewing, Andrew Gray: Jheald suggested using a federated query to the Ordnance Survey SPARQL endpoint.

Andrew Gray (talk) 23:16, 7 February 2020 (UTC) @Dipsacus fullonum, Larske, Tagishsimon, Pigsonthewing, Andrew Gray: Just as a bit of fun, here's a plot of the adjacency network: tinyurl.com/tgpsob9 (Caveats: straight line may be the shortest distance between two points, but does not necessarily indicate where the constituencies touch; some constituencies may not have TOIDs; some constituencies may be questionably located; query may take some time to run (anything up to the full minute); terms and conditions apply; value of queries may go down as well as up...) Jheald (talk) 23:49, 7 February 2020 (UTC) St Ives; Arundel; and Worthing West, amongst others, may need another look. Jheald (talk) 23:57, 7 February 2020 (UTC) It is possible with SPARQL to the query Ordnance Survey for their data of constituencies (at least name, located in the administrative territorial entity (P131), coordinate location (P625), shares border with (P47)), compare with Wikidata data and write lists of deviations. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 01:48, 8 February 2020 (UTC) By using #defaultView:Graph in the federated query above you can see the adjacencies graphically also for those that lack coordinate location (P625) statement. It is a bit messy with all UK constiuencies, but if you limit the set of objects by filtering on located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) it looks quite nice: Here is an example with the set limited to objects with located in the administrative territorial entity (P131) equal to Wales (Q25). I don't know if it is possible to give a \"hint\" to the graph rendering on which node to place top(north)most and which node to place right(east)most. Now I guess it is just luck if the graph places the nodes in the correct \"geographical order\" from a north-south and west-east point of view. --Larske (talk) 11:48, 8 February 2020 (UTC) I had a look at St Ives & iirc Arundel; reluctant to say that I didn't see any issues, though not much wanting to get more drawn into this, nor to be told exactly how wrong I was.

 Try it! But I'm getting a timeout as soon as I request labels (?communeLabel ?wikivoyageArticleLabel ?wikipediaArticleLabel). Even after following query optimizations I can find a way to make it work.Can you help me to optimize this request ?Thanks. You cannot use the label service for Wikipedia and Wikivoyage articles. These are not items and don't have labels. You can however URI decode the article links to make them more readable for humans. It can be done with: BIND(wikibase:decodeUri(SUBSTR(STR(?wikivoyageArticle), 32)) AS ?wikivoyageTitel)
BIND(wikibase:decodeUri(SUBSTR(STR(?wikipediaArticle), 31)) AS ?wikipediaTitel)
 I don't understand why you have hint:Query hint:optimizer \"None\" . In my tests it only slows down the query. Another issue is that you get too many results because some of coordinate values comes twice. That isn't your fault (see phab:T245135), but until it is fixed you should restrict your results in the subquery with \"group by\" and aggregation functions to only one result per commune and only add the optional values outside of the subquery. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 11:34, 13 February 2020 (UTC) ?wikipediaArticle schema:isPartOf <https://en.wikipedia.org/>; schema:name ?enwiki
 gives the article title --- Jura 12:12, 13 February 2020 (UTC) Thanks, I edited my query, following your advices (as I understand them). This is better but I'm still getting timeout --- Aximem 14:03, 13 February 2020 (UTC) @Aximem: I have a few more ideas: 1) Use Jura's good suggestion of using schema:name to get the titles: OPTIONAL { 
    ?wikivoyageArticle schema:about ?commune.
    ?wikivoyageArticle schema:isPartOf <https://en.wikivoyage.org/>.
    ?wikivoyageArticle schema:name ?wikivoyageTitel.
  }
 and likewise for Wikipedia articles. 2) Use sample() instead of min() as aggregation function:   SELECT ?commune (SAMPLE(?lat) AS ?latitude) (SAMPLE(?lng) AS ?longitude)
 Then the engine can just use any value without doing any comparison. That being said I cannot either get the query to run without timeout when including ?communeLabel. I tried to get the label without using the label service, but it doesn't help. I suggest that you either obmit the label and instead look at the Wikipedia titel (the difference is that the latter includes disambiguation), or alternatively limit the number of results, e.g. by only looking at only one region/arrondissement/departement per query. The aggregation and sorting by postal code also takes time. It reduces the number of results from 39551 to 39129, but sorting that many values isn't negligible and could be obmitted if it isn't important. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 21:24, 13 February 2020 (UTC) Again Thanks for your advices, indeed I can't make it work when using labels so, as you suggested, I decided to filter request to get less results: FILTER (?communePostalCode > \"0\" && ?communePostalCode < \"10000\")
 And I will use 10 requests (10001 - 20000 ... until 99999 for France) to get all datas. Thanks --- Aximem 08:27, 14 February 2020 (UTC) @Aximem: That is good idea using the postal codes to get smaller chunks of data. Be aware that not all items for communes have a value for P281, so after the 10 requests going from postal codes 0 to 99999, you will probably want to add a request to find these. For that last request replace ?commune wdt:P281 ?communePostalCode. FILTER (?communePostalCode > \"0\" && ?communePostalCode < \"10000\") with FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?commune wdt:P281 ?communePostalCode. } --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 08:04, 14 February 2020 (UTC) @Dipsacus fullonum: You are right, thanks for the advice. --- Aximem 09:24, 14 February 2020 (UTC) Counts by decade Items used: Alain (Q2829505)   Properties used: given name (P735)   , date of birth (P569)   #defaultView:LineChart

My URL come from the french Wikipedia (fr.wikipedia.org). Could someone write me a SPARQL request in which I could dump my URL and get the Q items as a result in a column ?--René La contemporaine (talk) 10:46, 19 February 2020 (UTC) You could dump the page titles them on https://tools.wmflabs.org/wikidata-todo/quick_statements.php followed by a tab, P1, Q0 and fill in \"frwiki\" in \"First column are articles from \". As P1 doesn't exist it will just convert them. --- Jura 11:03, 19 February 2020 (UTC) Jura So I tried to follow your procedure. 1)I filled \"frwiki\" in \"First column are articles from \" 2) I copy/pasted from a sheet an example with frwikiURL[TAB]P1[TAB]Q0 but the only result I got is MISSING P1 Q0.

See https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cuisse_de_Nymphe&action=info --- Jura 11:46, 19 February 2020 (UTC) Jura Now I understand ! I don't have the article's names, I have the URLs. It works when I enter the names. I can easily transform URL in names and follow the process except for certain URL where diacritics mess up the names (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Ch%C3%A9radame example). So would there be a way to do it directrly with URL ?--René La contemporaine (talk) 11:57, 19 February 2020 (UTC) There is also a dedicated tool for that at https://tools.wmflabs.org/wikidata-todo/linked_items.php --- Jura 11:53, 19 February 2020 (UTC)  """@en;
