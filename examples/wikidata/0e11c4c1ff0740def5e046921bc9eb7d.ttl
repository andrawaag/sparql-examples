Matěj Suchánek (talk) 20:14, 1 April 2017 (UTC) Thank you! --Bigbossfarin (talk) 20:15, 1 April 2017 (UTC) Members of the Tweede Kamer at some point in time I'm working on member of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands (Q18887908) and I'm trying to make a query to show the members at a point in time. I got the two parts workingPeople where the point in time is between the time they entered and left. SELECT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE {

 Try it! People where the point in time is after they entered and these people are still a member now. SELECT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE {

 Try it! Matěj Suchánek (talk) 08:14, 2 April 2017 (UTC) @Matěj Suchánek: thanks! I'm pretty sure I tried that and it returned zero results, I must have made a mistake in it somewhere. Do you know a way to only have one bind for ?pointintime ? I did manage to make this one to show progress: Graphs are temporarily unavailable due to technical issues. See Wikidata query.(should be 150) Multichill (talk) 10:45, 2 April 2017 (UTC) I hope this returns the same results: SELECT ?pointintime (COUNT(?item) AS ?count) WHERE {

 Try it! Matěj Suchánek (talk) 10:55, 2 April 2017 (UTC) Graphs are temporarily unavailable due to technical issues. See Wikidata query.Had to wrap it in a DISTINCT and do some evil wiki trick ({{!}}) to get it to work. Graphs seem to look the same. Multichill (talk) 11:06, 2 April 2017 (UTC) Description different than I need a filter to detect item with description in language different than a specific string.

 Try it! Maybe this will work? It gives no matching results, but a bot is adding such descriptions in all latin languages, so that is why there may be no results... Q.Zanden questions? 17:12, 2 April 2017 (UTC) It work, I found some item with error (example), but in some case I have time out. It's possible move ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q4167836 . in the second part of the querty? Maybe can be more efficient. --ValterVB (talk) 17:39, 2 April 2017 (UTC) But that is only a temporary example. That statement is already deleted. But maybe, if you create a test item with instance of (P31) ->Wikimedia category (Q4167836), but without a description... Just to test if the query works. Q.Zanden questions? 17:53, 2 April 2017 (UTC) The query work, I have already fixed some items. --ValterVB (talk) 18:02, 2 April 2017 (UTC) Get all newspapers in USA I would like to collect all newspapers in USA . I have written a query to get newspapers. but its not listing out all available newspapers from wiki.QUERY - version 1: SELECT ?newspaper ?newspaperLabel  ?link WHERE {

 Try it! Not all the newspaper is falls under major category as newspaper(Instance of newspaper) . some of them are in different categories like daily newspaper , weekly newspaper . Thus i have added those category(actually i should say this as sub-category of newspaper) in the code.QUERY - version 2: SELECT ?newspaper ?newspaperLabel ?link WHERE {
  {?newspaper wdt:P31 wd:Q1331793} UNION
  {?newspaper wdt:P31 wd:Q2138556} union

 Try it! Still its not listing out all the newspapers.Though some of them are instance of 'newspaper',Query is not listing out them in result. Example : The Alabama Observer : https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7712961 Query : version 2 is not listed above newspaper even though it is instance of newspaper.Please help me to resolve this problem – The preceding unsigned comment was added by WikiCompBot (talk • contribs). Q7712961 does not have filled country (P17). You may use PetScan (and enwiki category \"Newspapers published in the United States by state\" and its subcategories to fill these gaps in Wikidata. --Jklamo (talk) 08:40, 29 March 2017 (UTC) Thanks a lot dude. Its working fine. One more help. When i try the same query for different countries , its not giving any results.
   For Ex : Newspapers published in the China by state
   Any Help Would Be Appreciated!! Why do you use country (P17) in newspapers at all?? I think that country of origin (P495) is more suitable for creative works. --Infovarius (talk) 08:39, 4 April 2017 (UTC) Count scripts ?
