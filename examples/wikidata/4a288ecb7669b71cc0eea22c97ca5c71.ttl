  rdfs:comment " This page is an archive. Please do not modify it. Use the current page, even to continue an old discussion. Contents 1 Redirects after archival 2 Adding Properties in a QuickStatements like Format with a Bot 3 Bot to switch out combined items like second-person plural (Q51929403) with second person (Q51929049) and plural (Q146786) 4 Fix ru description for given names 5 English description cleanup (items for people) 6 Import places in Luxembourg from Commons (one time data import) Redirects after archival Request date: 11 September 2017, by: Jsamwrites Link to discussions justifying the request Following a comment on the request made on the Wikidata:Contact_the_development_team, I am posting it here. As described in the previous link, currently the links on Project Chat, Request For Query and even Contact the development team, do not get redirected to the corresponding archive page, once archived. Take for example, Wikidata:Contact_the_development_team#Redirects_after_archive may not work after a while. It was however suggested that bots can be created to resolve this issue. Task description Retain the links to the original discussion section on the discussion pages, even after archival by allowing redirection. Licence of data to import (if relevant) Discussion Support Good idea which I've also had in the past. It may even be possible for the bot doing the archiving to take care of this at the same time. @Hazard-SJ: thoughts? --SilentSpike (talk) 16:06, 2 February 2020 (UTC) Request process Adding Properties in a QuickStatements like Format with a Bot Is there a possibility to add properties to items in a Format like in QuickStatements or a format with one command per line, what is easy to create out of a QuickStatements Format. I think if someone wants to add something to many items then this would help. I ask it because someone uploads at the moment a lot of batches with 40k contributions per batch to QuickStatements. I also add many descriptions and I think for cases like that it would help. -- Hogü-456 (talk) 20:41, 5 February 2020 (UTC) Bot to switch out combined items like second-person plural (Q51929403) with second person (Q51929049) and plural (Q146786) For lexemes, there are different items to label their forms. A problem is that some are like \"first-person singular\" while others are \"first person\" and \"singular\". I've seen discussions (e.g.) that determine that using the combined ones is bad. Could someone make a bot please that switches these out? It's hard to do by hand. I'd make one, but there don't seem to be any tools to allow someone like me without much experience programming to make one. Thanks. DemonDays64 | Talk to me 15:23, 26 January 2020 (UTC) Clarification: this was originally on a talk page but was moved here. I do not have the skills to make a bot on Wikidata like this, so I am just asking if someone else could do this. Thanks!
