Wikidata -> BF Crosswalks [edit] I wouldn't suggest that SPARQL is the best mechanism to do these crosswalks, it's just a semi-convenient way to do it using online data and tools. Identifiers and Notes [edit] Crosswalk ISBN identifiers from Wikidata to BF 2.0 (method 1) [edit] Unfortunately, WDQS doesn't return Turtle and the RDF/XML option is pretty-much unreadable.
