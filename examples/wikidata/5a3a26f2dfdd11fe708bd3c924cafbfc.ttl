(I've also made lots of stuff optional, since you may not have DoB and PoB, for instance. Nor am I familiar with Spanish political seat P39 statements, so some of my choices more reflect the UK way of doing things, but yuo can see the pattern & can adjust it to suit Spain.) See also https://wdqs-tutorial.toolforge.org/index.php/category/simple-queries/qualifiers/ You'll get multiple rows for a single individual who has multiple qualifying P39 statements, so there's another job, possibly, of aggregating the data.

I'm not sure what is causing this. That's a problem far from my skills to resolve. I have followed the DOI of these items and added the journal article's title to the item's label and title, but there are so many. I'm not even sure one couldn't create yet another item with that DOI using SourceMD (resulting in another item to fix). Example, Q58391055 is such an item.Can someone create a list for me that has the QID and the DOI (as a link, preferably) for those items with DOI (P356) that start with 10.1023/A: without a Label or a title (P1476), I can create a table to generate a correction through QuickStatement.If anyone can prevent this from continuing to happen, it would be nice to think there's a list that I can correct and it won't continue to add new items without a title.

(see, for instance, this recent short thread on EN wiki's WP:WiR.) --Tagishsimon (talk) 21:06, 15 July 2021 (UTC) @Tagishsimon, Magnus Manske: many thanks for your help, Tagishsimon! I'll try and develop the code further, here to include the article name, but like you, I'm getting the Killed by OS for overloading memory. It's a pity, as most editors / Wikipedias don't realise the potential of this tool as a 'See also' query + return. I'll resort to an external db of info and copy and paste into WP as a table. All language WP could have a list of wanted articles, and which articles on their wiki are stubs (under 10k bytes) etc. A table isn't as good as doing it on the fly, but there we are! We are where we are! Thanks again!

 Try it! I can see in the JSON of Q758 that the unit should be http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104907187 or http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q55726194 but I'm referring to it wrongly. Can someone help? Carlinmack (talk) 14:02, 16 July 2021 (UTC) @Carlinmack: The quantityUnit hangs off a psv: statement value, so you need to find the appropriate psv: and its statement value, something like this: SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?property ?propertyLabel ?value ?valueLabel ?unit ?unitLabel
WITH {
  SELECT ?statement WHERE { 
	  ?statement prov:wasDerivedFrom/pr:P248 wd:Q105645500 .

Beyond that, all of the subjects needed to be ?item, not ?titre ... I think if the P18 clause had not failed, the ?titre clauses would have led to a timeout. Here's a revised version which is probably nearer your intention, although whether you are wanting to sort by the RU article name (?article) or the RU item label (?itemLabel) is not clear. Also, the query is requiring there to be a P18 image on wikidata ... it has no way of seeing whether there is a Commons or RU-wiki image on the RU article.

 Try it! The result is sorted by itemLabel, thus Praha 1 is followed by Praha 10, then Prague 2 by Praha 20 etc. Is there a way to sort Praha 1, then Praha 2-9, then Praha 10 etc.?
