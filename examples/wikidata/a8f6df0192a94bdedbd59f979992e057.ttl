It references https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.426854 which also has the same title (and is possibly the source). It seems like the title is supposed to contain chemical elements with subscripts. I failed to figure out the correct title. Can someone help?--37.201.30.22 20:52, 1 March 2019 (UTC) It's mentioned at http://www.isni.org/isni/0000000135489107, which is better, but probably not perfect. Ghouston (talk) 04:22, 2 March 2019 (UTC) References to Pb(Mg₁/₃Nb₂/₃)O₃ can be found elsewhere, so it's probably that.

Moebeus (talk) 01:25, 6 March 2019 (UTC) This section was archived on a request by: Moebeus (talk) 01:25, 6 March 2019 (UTC) Anti-abuse save-error nonsense I'm running five quickstatement batches to add descriptions to 50k CBDB people items; e.g. \"Ming dynasty person CBDB=34576\" to Xie Qian (Q45426084) so that we have a more of a clue, when searching, about who these people are. QS is reporting many many errors.Doing the job manually, I'm getting \"Could not save due to an error. The save has failed. As an anti-abuse measure, you are limited from performing this action too many times in a short space of time, and you have exceeded this limit. Please try again in a few minutes.\"May I politely ask, what the fuck? QS is rate limited in line with wikidata's capacity to accept edits. Wikidata by its nature will be subject to large-scale serial edits like this. What fresh hell has been imposed on us to frustrate these edits? --Tagishsimon (talk) 11:46, 26 February 2019 (UTC) Any batch tool you use needs to comply with the server etiquette and that etiquette includes taking into account rate limits. If the tool cannot handle a rate limit error then it should be fixed by its maintainer. TheDJ (talk) 14:43, 26 February 2019 (UTC) My understanding is that quickstatements is rate limited. That's why I said \"QS is rate limited in line with wikidata's capacity to accept edits.\" --Tagishsimon (talk) 14:51, 26 February 2019 (UTC) Quickstatements works fine if you run into this, just reset the errors when the rest of the batch has finished and it will automatically re-try them. But you should probably not try to do more than 2 simultaneously or you will hit this. ArthurPSmith (talk) 18:48, 26 February 2019 (UTC) A while ago the general idea was that if you add 50K items that's the kind of action that shouldn't happen automated without a bot approval. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 14:33, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Daty Wikidata Editor beta release Hi everyone,Pellegrino Prevete, aka Ogoorcs, here again to announce the release of the beta version of Daty, the native Wikidata editor that has already been mentioned on this board last month, which aims to simplify Wikidata user experience for new as for old users.This month saw a rewrite of the open entities dialog, which first version was righteous found not much intuitive.Filter search (i.e. graphical SPARQL queries) has been introduced, too, which usability is of course on you to test.In fact, despite the improvements, the failure of many testers in using filters, brought me to write and integrate a little manual to the program which has been made available online for windows users.In this version you will also find: a new GTK+ theme, close buttons for entities in the editor, unsourced statement visually distinguished from referenced ones, huge performance improvements and an entities download cache. Editing has been disabled in this release, too. It will probably be activated in one of the march intermediate releases, just after references visualization will be completed.I recently published the issue boards, which I am using as to-do manager. So, if you want to follow the work but you do not want to read the commit list you can read that.I recommended current and future users to endorse the project at this page. Download Installers are available for Microsoft Windows (64 bit) and GNU/Linux.Complete release notes have been published on my website; bug reporting happens here. Notes for Mac users I recently buyed a used mac which should arrive mid march, so the .app will probably be ready for the next release, barring unforeseen circumstances.Ogoorcs (talk) 23:45, 27 February 2019 (UTC) Discussion Looking forward to trying it when Ubuntu 19.04 comes out :-) Syced (talk) 05:48, 1 March 2019 (UTC) It would be great to an automatic update function on windows. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 14:59, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Add all Sámi languages in WikidataWikimedia Finland is starting to work with Sámi communities during the year. Only Northern (sme) and Southern (sma) Sámi are available in Wikidata, while the following ones are missign: sju – Ume, sje – Pite, smj – Lule, sjk – Kemi, smn – Inari, sms – Skolt, sia – Akkala, sjd – Kildin, sjt – Ter. Two of them are already extinct, but there is need to use them nevertheless. What is the procedure to add languages in Wikidata? – Best, Susanna Ånäs (Susannaanas) (talk) 17:38, 1 March 2019 (UTC)I see it has just been asked. Feel free to complement, but I think the above question helps already! – Susanna Ånäs (Susannaanas) (talk) 17:44, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Can one just ask for a language for it to show up as an option in monolingual fields eventually? Because I'll then be happy to get Réunion Creole (Q13198) created under the rcf code! Thierry Caro (talk) 17:51, 1 March 2019 (UTC) To get a new language added for monolingual properties, see the procedure outlined at Help:Monolingual text languages. For a new language to be used with labels and descriptions, you also need to create Phabricator tickets. --Pasleim (talk) 17:58, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Study to understand Wikidata? NO WIKIDATA ID FOUND! Valfornace (Q28104985) and Category:Valfornace in wikimedia commons - I ca'nt bring they together - Can someone help?- nach Jahren ist Wikidata noch immer ein Buch mit sieben Siegeln für mich - undurchschaubar, stellenweise nicht nachvollziehbar und für Laien wie mich, die nur Schulenglisch hatten absolut unverständlich - Selbst so etwas Simples, wie die Verknüpfung einer Wikidata-ID mit einer Kategorie in Wikimedia ist für mich unergründlich. - Schade, dass Wikidata kein bisschen besser wurde - irgendwo wird das sicher stehen, wie es gemacht wird, aber ich hab keine Lust mehr hier stundenlang zu suchen. Adelfrank (talk) 17:46, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Auf der Seite des Items Valfornace (Q28104985)(https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28104985) unter \"Andere Websites\"(in der Spalte, in der auch die Wikipedia Artikel verlinkt sind) Commons eintragen und dann Category:Valfornace als die Seite. (Hier habe ich das jetzt gemacht.) --GPSLeo (talk) 18:00, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Danke - das hätte ich nie im Leben gefunden - schön blöd, dass wenn man dem Link \"NO WIKIDATA ID FOUND!\" folgt, keinerlei Hinweis oder Ziel erscheint - Bei Wikidata gehen bei mir beide Daumen runter- ist nur für Fachleute geeignet, ich finde das Projekt miserabel erklärt - aber dafür kannst Du ja nichts und den Machern ist es egal - nochmals vielen Dank von Adelfrank (talk) 18:20, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Q61876969 For The Man Inside (Q61876969) I am getting a suggestion/error to use \"manifestation of\" because I added a \"Internet Broadway Database production ID\", I am not sure what it is asking for and I cannot find an example to help me. --RAN (talk) 01:47, 26 February 2019 (UTC) A theatrical productrion would be a manifestation of the play itself (considered as a written work independent of any particular cast or production). - PKM (talk) 20:39, 26 February 2019 (UTC) @PKM: So every produced play gets two entries, one for the written play and one for the produced play? --RAN (talk) 04:49, 27 February 2019 (UTC) I think not so much \"gets\" as \"can get\". A lot of the time, we seem to conflate these things when there is only one significant production, but as soon as there are two or more, you pretty much have to go that way if you want to describe them. - Jmabel (talk) 04:54, 27 February 2019 (UTC) Yes, thanks, that is how the IBDB handles it too, even as you point out play=production when it its only performed in one run. IBDB has two IDs for each produced play for this reason, now I understand. --RAN (talk) 20:51, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Right tool for multiple edits Hi all. I want to change all items that list field of work (P101) as differential equation (Q11214) and make it theory of differential equations (Q28575007) instead. I know there's at least one tool that allows one to do this easily and in fact I've used such a tool a while ago. Unfortunately, I can't recall what that tool is! Can anyone help? Pichpich (talk) 21:40, 28 February 2019 (UTC) One way would be to use Wikidata Query Service to list the items to be changed, save the output as CSV, and use an advanced text editor to convert it into commands for QuickStatements. Maybe there's an easier way. Ghouston (talk) 22:14, 28 February 2019 (UTC) @Pichpich, Ghouston: For straightforward edits (ie you don't want to worry about references or qualifiers) you can use Petscan. This link is preset to: run a SPARQL query for all items with P101:Q11214 (under the Other sources tab) set up a batch edit to remove the P101:Q11214 and add P101:Q28575007 (the box in the lower right, above the search results) You'll need to log into Widar (link above the search results) reload the page, and then hit \"process commands\". It will run your selected changes on all items ticked in the list (by default all search results are ticked). Andrew Gray (talk) 22:23, 28 February 2019 (UTC) This looks handy, thanks. The commands box wasn't easy to find. Ghouston (talk) 22:42, 28 February 2019 (UTC) You might also use TABernacle [1] for this sort of work. - PKM (talk) 23:55, 28 February 2019 (UTC) Thanks for the help everyone. I think I used an earlier version of Petscan way back when. Pichpich (talk) 19:45, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Harassment and other negative issues in Wikidata I am wondering whether we have seen any instances of harasment or discriminatory behavior on Wikidata. It has been speculated in Creating Structured Linked Data to Generate Scholarly Profiles: A Pilot Project using Wikidata and Scholia (Q59652985): \"...may be wary of participating in open community platform that may expose contributors to discriminatory behavior and harassment.\". I cannot come up with a single instance. — Finn Årup Nielsen (fnielsen) (talk) 14:08, 1 March 2019 (UTC) I have seen heated discussions based on genuine disagreement about how our ontology should be structured, but I have not seen anything I would call discriminatory behavior or harassment. - PKM (talk) 21:48, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Unfortunately I can think of more than a single instance. But clearly it is not nearly as bad as enwiki. - Brya (talk) 06:05, 2 March 2019 (UTC) Possible duplicates: Brazilian botanist Geraldo José Peixoto Ramos and Brazilian researcher Geraldo José Peixoto Ramos Looks to me like Geraldo José Peixoto Ramos and Geraldo José Peixoto Ramos might be the same person. Anyone up on Brazilian botany researchers have a look? Moebeus (talk) 14:00, 7 March 2019 (UTC) Merged based on PT Google Scholar and IPNI record. - PKM (talk) 03:57, 8 March 2019 (UTC) Thank you! Moebeus (talk) 23:44, 8 March 2019 (UTC) This section was archived on a request by: Moebeus (talk) 23:44, 8 March 2019 (UTC) Part of a sequence I've been asked to take a look on sequences in navigational templates, and found that there are a lot of errors. It seems like User:DeltaBot has made some changes, that not only breaks the expected behavior, but the changes are also wrong.An item can be part of a sequence. It is no sequence by itself, and that is very important. It is part of a sequence. That means the item has follows (P155) and followed by (P156), and those statements points to other items in the same sequence.An item 1932 European Figure Skating Championships (Q1318059) is a figure skating competition (Q2990963), it has a relation to European Figure Skating Championships (Q869121), and that might hold a sequence. If you want to create a sequence of championships (items) as a list, then you put that list in European Figure Skating Championships (Q869121). The item 1932 European Figure Skating Championships (Q1318059) has follows (P155) and followed by (P156), and those points to 1931 European Figure Skating Championships (Q694528) and 1933 European Figure Skating Championships (Q1318067).Another way to formulate this is functional data for the item first, then limiting context for the functional data.~A qualifier is the limiting context. Using a qualifier for the functional data creates all sorts of problems, in particular the present parser functions must nearly always be replaced with modules, which makes it really hard for small projects to use Wikidata.I leave it as a readers exercise to figure out the difference to marriages.This is a real mess now, not sure who created the idea used for these structures as they are now. It is possible to write a module to hack around the problems, but it would be better to fix it on this project. Jeblad (talk) 14:07, 28 February 2019 (UTC) Recent discussion: Wikidata:Project chat/Archive/2019/02#Sport events editions and P3450. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 18:06, 1 March 2019 (UTC) An item can be part of many sequences, thus follows (P155) and followed by (P156) are by themselves ambiguous. Only if they are used as qualifier of a series property it is unambiguous. For example, the successor of the 2018 Winter Olympics can be the 2022 Winter Olympics or the 2020 Summer Olympics, depending which sequence is considered. Even for cases like 1932 European Figure Skating Championships (Q1318059) the sequence is ambiguous. Somebody who is interested in French sports events may say that 1932 Tour de France (Q261798) is the successor of 1932 European Figure Skating Championships (Q1318059) because that was the next big sport event in France. Or 1956 European Figure Skating Championships (Q1318159) can also be as successor of 1932 European Figure Skating Championships (Q1318059) because that's the next European Figure Skating Championships held in Paris. --Pasleim (talk) 10:06, 2 March 2019 (UTC) Keyboard shortcut to add statement? While wikignoming I add thousands of statements manually (to existing items).I am not a fan of mouses and the \"add statement\" link is quite a long way to reach by TABs.Question: Is there a keyboard shortcut? It would have the same effect as clicking on \"add statement\".Thanks! Syced (talk) 05:43, 1 March 2019 (UTC) @Syced: the \"Gadgets\" sections in Preferences has a \"KeyShortcuts\" option. With that turned on you can use the 'a' shortcut to add a new statement. --Oravrattas (talk) 08:05, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Ah cool thanks! I googled for such a feature but this talk page discussion did not catch my eye. It might be worth transforming it into a real help page :-) Syced (talk) 08:28, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Thanks for the tip! I've been wondering about this as well. -- ElanHR (talk) 05:44, 3 March 2019 (UTC) Complicated Situation Hi,fa:رده:اهالی پلوپونز is a category in Farsi Wikipediaen:Category:People from the Peloponnese is the same category in English Wikipediain both category consist of some interwikithere are thousands of categories which have the same situationModern Sciences (talk) 18:04, 2 March 2019 (UTC) @Modern Sciences: The two sets of categories have corresponding Wikidata items Category:People from the Peloponnese (Q7923846) and Category:Births in Peloponnesos (Q7118630). (You can find these, as you probably know, by following the \"Wikidata item\" link in the sidebar of the Wikipedia page). If these Wikidata items were equivalent, it would normally be easy to merge them. However, note that they both have links to Russian wikipedia -- to two different pages. This suggests either that they are not equivalent, or that some clean-up is needed. If we now go to ru:Категория:Персоналии:Пелопоннес (corresponding to Category:People from the Peloponnese (Q7923846)) the situation becomes more clear. This category includes not only the category corresponding to Category:Births in Peloponnesos (Q7118630), but also a category for people who died there. (One might also distinguish a further sub-group of people who neither were born there, nor died there, but lived there for a time). So it would appear that there are genuinely two different concepts here. But whether each of the categories in each of the languages is currently connected to the correct concept, that I can't guarantee. Jheald (talk) 21:35, 2 March 2019 (UTC) Duplicating Item Is there an easy/quick way to duplicate an item? I'd like to make a duplicate and then change the values that need to be changed, rather than having to copy most of the values from one item to another.

U+1F360 (talk) 18:59, 2 March 2019 (UTC) Country (P17) -- current country or historical country ? I had always thought that country (P17) was supposed to take the value of a present-day sovereign state, to assist with searching. (E.g. for a query like this one, tinyurl.com/y2wk3j2j, for battles fought in the UK or Ireland).But when adding Ireland (Q27) for Battle of the Boyne (Q644960) I am getting a constraint warning contemporary constraint (Q25796498) : \"The entities Battle of the Boyne and Ireland should be contemporary to be linked through country, but the latest end value of Battle of the Boyne is 11 July 1690 Gregorian and the earliest start value of Ireland is 29 December 1937.\" I think this constraint warning is unhelpful, and (if looking for ancient buildings, battle-sites, etc) will make searching rather difficult. But what do people think? Jheald (talk) 13:37, 22 February 2019 (UTC).IMO also, if the value of the property should always be the present-day sovereign state, it should be eg United Kingdom (Q145) rather than England (Q21). (diff) Jheald (talk) 13:54, 22 February 2019 (UTC) (Looking at Property talk:P17 it turns out there's already an auto-replace active, to change any value England (Q21) to United Kingdom (Q145) as a matter of course. So this aspect is already established. Though the auto-replace doesn't apply to Kingdom of England (Q179876).

It's a matter of consistency, using a country that was created after the entity disappeared makes no sense, it's not even possible to agree such a country in most cases. country (P17) is clearly a contemporary property; however, countries are also the entities whose data are the most inconsistent in Wikidata. There's a brief explanation (in Spanish, but easily translatable by automatic means) about the issues with countries on the work about the contemporary constraint, page 24. --abián 14:30, 22 February 2019 (UTC) On the contrary, it makes every sense to consistently use the present-day country for P17 rather the contemporary country, in order for the items to be readily discoverable -- eg for a query like the one at the top of this section to be able to work. Jheald (talk) 14:38, 22 February 2019 (UTC) The query and its answer are consistent. If the result doesn't meet the information needs, then the query should be improved. There are no one-to-one matches between all historical and current countries and, since those matches can't be set manually in any objective way, SPARQL can't do it either. If those matches were exact, then historical and current countries would be the same Items, it wouldn't even make sense to distinguish between historical and current countries. --abián 14:58, 22 February 2019 (UTC) The query gives a perfectly consistent answer to the question \"what battles occurred on the territory of the present-day sovereign states of Ireland and the UK\" -- the established understanding of P17. The query works because all the items ignore your constraint. If the items obeyed your constraint, the query would return very nearly a null set, and would be of much less usefulness. Jheald (talk) 15:57, 22 February 2019 (UTC) Sounds to me like this calls for two different properties, one specifically for a country contemporary with the event, one for a present-day country. - Jmabel (talk) 16:47, 22 February 2019 (UTC) P17 is a mess that I never totally understood (qv. the self-referencing, discuss multiple times on the property talk page, the last discussion being about self-referecing of historical countries) but here the problem is more general. I don't get why would someone want to put current value on something when it didn't existed, is may seem more easy but it's anachronic, not-perennial (no country will exist forever, what will call present is already the past) and country are not fully consistent. In the long run, it's just trouble waiting to happens, when a query can often easily infered the current country. For me, te contemporary constraint is totally logic here. Cdlt, VIGNERON (talk) 17:10, 22 February 2019 (UTC) It's incredibly useful to have a property so that one can know that all items with a geographical component -- eg including, but not limited to: settlements, battlefields, events (even if long abandoned) -- should be relateable to a modern country; so that one can drive for completeness, i.e. easily identify any that have coordinates but don't have a present-day country; and so one knows that in principle one should be able to search for all such objects within a country's territory and be reasonably likely to find them. This is a cornerstone for many national wikidata assessment and improvement efforts. It's also a very natural thing to want to be able to do. This was, I believe, the understanding of P17 before Abián added the constraint. It worries me that now, as a result of the constraint warnings, we are losing completeness; which then messes so many further things up in turn. Jheald (talk) 18:36, 22 February 2019 (UTC) ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ It does not help that many items like Russia (Q159) or Poland (Q36) serve a double duty as the concept of the \"country\" (for Poland starting in 10th century) and the latest incarnation of \"sovereign state\" (in case of Poland starting 1918). So articles about Poland and Russia cover both concepts (history of Poland talks about one and government of Poland talks about the other) and items have multiple \"inception\" dates. Boundaries of \"Poland\" changed a lot since 10th century, there were also significant changes since 1918. The \"contemporary\" constraints often make very little sense for such broadly defined concepts. And this confusion is not new to Wikidata, I remember that number of people killed in Poland during World War II changes drastically depending on if you consider pre or post war boundaries. --Jarekt (talk) 19:45, 22 February 2019 (UTC) I understand you. I am trying to clean up P17 (and P27) = Q159 values when I see it and change to some more appropriate historical values (such as Soviet Union (Q15180) or Sirtori (Q42166)). But Poland (Q36)... Some users even fight against my changes. Even more furiously with Baltic states... --Infovarius (talk) 12:20, 28 February 2019 (UTC) I'm not sure that there really is an \"established understanding\" on this. I suspect there are certain topic areas where are there are fairly well established conventions, but I'm less sure that those are going to be consistent everywhere. With political data, the convention is generally to use the relevant country at the time, not the current one: it would seem very odd to me, for example, to have the country (P17) on something like Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (Q326465) to be a present-day country (or 15 countries?), rather than Soviet Union (Q15180). --Oravrattas (talk) 21:23, 22 February 2019 (UTC) +1, it's unclear since the beggining (see the discussion, for instance Property talk:P17/Archive#Change this to be about modern countries in 2014 among many others). Cdlt, VIGNERON (talk) 21:54, 22 February 2019 (UTC) Regarding the original battle item, it makes sense to me that the country should be marked as the country at the time it occurred (the battle isn't still ongoing and therefore isn't present in the modern country). For a battlefield (Q4895508) item, then it would make sense to use the modern country because the site still exists there. Surely if someone wanted to query battles in the UK or Ireland as originally proposed, then it lies on the data consumer to query the historical data appropriately. --SilentSpike (talk) 21:59, 22 February 2019 (UTC) How should a country (P17) statement on an item like Battle of the Boyne (Q644960) be interpreted? Isn't it saying that the Republic of Ireland was one of the participants of the battle? The Republic was only founded in 1937. Ghouston (talk) 23:52, 22 February 2019 (UTC) I think it would be a useful thing, if a full schema for battles and campaigns could be worked up -- looking at eg en:Template:Infobox military conflict there can be quite detailed information in wiki infoboxes that I am not sure we yet have the ability to fully represent. It's also perhaps surprising that there seems to be no Military History wikiproject here yet, to host and maintain such a schema. But participant (P710) I think would be the normal way to record who participated in a battle, with country (P17) used to indicate where the battle was. Jheald (talk) 10:29, 23 February 2019 (UTC) Doesn't location (P276) give the location? But even as a location, the Republic of Ireland didn't exist until 1937. Also, states can be unreliable as locations, since their borders can change over time (consider the USA). Ghouston (talk) 10:35, 23 February 2019 (UTC) P276 should also give contemporary location (location existed at that moment). If this location still exists it can have some modern country as a P17 value. --Infovarius (talk) 12:20, 28 February 2019 (UTC) P17 can include both the current country and the historic one. The contemporary constraint was probably added without actually functioning or being discussed prior to addition. --- Jura 08:55, 24 February 2019 (UTC) This constraint is so right. A battle like being a citizen of a country can only be contemporary to the person or event involved.. Stating them in modern times is an historical falsehood. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 19:35, 24 February 2019 (UTC) P17 should not show countries that didn't exist at the same time as the topic. If there is no chronological overlap with modern entities, located in the present-day administrative territorial entity (P3842) can be used to link to modern areas. --Yair rand (talk) 20:04, 24 February 2019 (UTC) +1. P17 is for contemporary countries. Otherwise, Jheald, how would we query for all battles on the territory of Kingdom of England (Q179876)? --Infovarius (talk) 12:20, 28 February 2019 (UTC) @Infovarius: I think User:Jmabel was probably right above, when he said it would be useful to have both values. On Battle of Bosworth Field (Q222013) above, I have re-added United Kingdom (Q145) but with qualifier determination method (P459) = present-day boundaries (Q61912379). It would be useful to turn off the constraint warning when this qualifier combination is present. Jheald (talk) 12:28, 28 February 2019 (UTC) valid in period (P1264) = present (Q193168) might also be appropriate way to indicate this. Jheald (talk) 13:20, 28 February 2019 (UTC) Another hypothetical way to query all (historical and not) points inside some territory should be use of coordinate location (P625). But it can be possible only when some boundary property will be used... --Infovarius (talk) 12:20, 28 February 2019 (UTC) I think what this ignores is how useful it is to be able to specify and retrieve a country (P17) as a relatively easy, quick, straightforward initial form of classification, based just on present-day boundaries. We may not have coordinates for the battle. It may be quite difficult to specify what historic territory it occurred in -- eg whose territory was Battle of Degsastan (Q2712138) fought on? Or Battle of Deorham (Q1429157)? It may be difficult to identify all the relevant historical territories for a set of present-day boundaries: wikidata doesn't currently have that information easily available, even for a country like United Kingdom (Q145). And if land was captured by one state, then recaptured by another state, whose territory was that second battle fought on? Also, if one wants to find battles fought in the present-day territory of Lithuania (Q37), one probably doesn't want to find everything fought in Grand Duchy of Lithuania (Q49683). So the idea of querying by matching back from present-day states to historical states doesn't really work. Alternatively it has been suggested to use located in the present-day administrative territorial entity (P3842), but this requires someone to have made the effort to have identified what the relevant present-day administrative entity would be; and also that the administrative tree is in good enough shape that it would be found for a search for a present-day country. The key advantage of systematically including present-day country (P17) values is that they are almost always easily available, so it's something where one can aim for systematic good property-completeness as an immediate first step without too much difficulty. That makes them a very good initial stage in any data improvement drive; as well as providing an enabling basis of organisation for further improvement, by breaking the overall set into natural manageable chunks by present-day country that can then be the targets for further improvement. It's also a very useful property to have for comparison to external lists. Whatever solution we adopt to make it possible, these attributes must not be lost. Jheald (talk) 12:57, 28 February 2019 (UTC) I tend to agree that P17 should avoid anachronisms. In SPARQL is it possible to create a kind of \"function\" that gives all items whose coordinates fall into a given current country (or region)? That would be the best for both usages. Syced (talk) 06:02, 1 March 2019 (UTC) @Syced: It's not really possible, no. The nearest one can currently get is to ask for coordinates within a bounding circle or rectangle; or to try to identify a tree of historical entities to include; or if the items have a located in the present-day administrative territorial entity (P3842) value, to try to gather up matching items via that tree. But as commented immediately above, most items don't have located in the present-day administrative territorial entity (P3842) set; and there are some quite severe problems (even in principle) trying to get the right entities via their historical associations. Both approaches are a mile away from the immediate accessibility of P17, as well as being a lot more expensive to query -- a key consideration when the solution sets may be very big. It's easy enough working offline to find code that will reasonably efficiently calculate within which of a number of possible boundaries a point falls. This makes the modern P17 something which can very efficiently be calculated offline, then written to Wikidata to make available online the useful grouping noted above. The GeoSPARQL standard includes a function geof:sfWithin() to ask whether a point is within a polygon. But Blazegraph doesn't implement GeoSPARQL, only regular SPARQL. Possibly a similar function could be added as a SERVICE call by the WDQS developers; or, alternatively, a more efficient call that would work as a generator rather than a filter, taking directly into account the Z-order curve Blazegraph uses to spatially index points. But neither such call is available at present, and they would have to compete with quite a lot of other priorities to gain rather limited developer time. Jheald (talk) 09:27, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Pinging @Lucas Werkmeister (WMDE): for thoughts, in case he has anything to add. Jheald (talk) 09:38, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Nothing to add from my staff role except that T204045 is the task for GeoSPARQL support, if anyone wants to follow it. --Lucas Werkmeister (WMDE) (talk) 10:39, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Solution using qualifiers? A few lines above, I have suggested using qualifiers to indicate when a P17 value is for the corresponding present-day country, not a historically contemporary one.Some questions: Do people feel that such an approach would broadly be acceptable, and viable? If so, what would be the best qualifier/value combination to indicate that the statement refers to a present-day country. E.g. determination method (P459) = present-day boundaries (Q61912379) valid in period (P1264) = present (Q193168) or something else? Is there a way to turn off the contemporary constraint (Q25796498) warning when such a qualifer/value combination is present? Or, perhaps, introduce a second, weakened form of the constraint to indicate that for some properties a value with such a combination is acceptable? What do people think? Jheald (talk) 14:39, 3 March 2019 (UTC) Maybe we should differentiate between various types of concepts using P17: for locations, using past and present values shouldn't be an issue. For some aspects of long gone countries, present day countries aren't of much use. Many are between these two. --- Jura 17:18, 3 March 2019 (UTC) Battlefields I also see we currently have separate entries for Battle of Bosworth Field (Q222013) and Bosworth Field site (Q55876564).I think this is also unhelpful, and would propose to merge them. According to Reasonator, we currently have only 46 items that are instance of (P31) battlefield (Q4895508) [2].In almost all cases therefore we will not have a separate item, so that would be the general expectation that searchers and queryers would expect. I don't see much value in having these as separate items. Exceptions might be if there are sitelinks, or if there is a significant set of properties that one would want to clarify apply to a preserved park, rather than the full original site; but otherwise I think it is not worth going against the general rule. Jheald (talk) 13:50, 22 February 2019 (UTC) @Jheald: I think this is very helpful and much more clear to have separate item. Merging a point in time and a point in space would be messy and that would be unhelpful. Plus, as you said, in most case, the merge is impossible: see Waterloo Battlefield (Q16507442) and Battle of Waterloo (Q48314) with two distinct articles. Of the 47 items, 33 have a sitelink (70%). Cheers, VIGNERON (talk) 11:37, 24 February 2019 (UTC) @Jheald: I also think that the battlefield should have a separate item. Some battlefields in Canada are national historic site of Canada (Q1568567), who is a designation of the place and not the event. Also, i see that a lot of battlefields are probably have theater of war (Q718893) instead of battlefield (Q4895508). We probably have some migration to do. --Fralambert (talk) 15:49, 24 February 2019 (UTC) Structure of sports organizations/clubs/teams Hello. Please, if you are interested, say your opinion at Wikidata talk:WikiProject Sports#Structure of sports organizations/clubs/teams. Xaris333 (talk) 10:46, 3 March 2019 (UTC) Inverse of P831 Hello. The inverse of parent organization (P749) is has subsidiary (P355). What is the inverse of parent club (P831)? If we don't have one, do we need one? It'a about sports teams. We can say that ⟨ Olympiacos F.C. (Q19628)    ⟩ parent club (P831) ⟨ Olympiacos SFP (Q12396315)    ⟩ but how we can say that ⟨ Olympiacos SFP (Q12396315)    ⟩ \"departments\" Search ⟨  Q19628 ⟩ I used to use has part(s) (P527) but P527 is not the inverse of parent club (P831). P527 is the inverse of part of (P361). If we can use P527 then we can also use P361 instead of P831, but that is wrong. Xaris333 (talk) 03:37, 2 March 2019 (UTC) Between organisations(multi sport club and football club) use subsidiary and parent organization. Between team and club/organization use part of and has part. Since team is part of football club, it is implied that the football club is the parent club --Unnited meta (talk) 02:08, 3 March 2019 (UTC) Hello @Unnited meta:. Please read Wikidata talk:WikiProject Sports#Structure of sports organizations/clubs/teams. A multi-sport club is not a parent club for a football club. A multi-sport club and a football club are parents club of teams. If we are going to use part of and has part, then parent club (P831) it will not be used at all. @Amadalvarez:. Xaris333 (talk) 10:43, 3 March 2019 (UTC) I think that who created P831 wanted to illustrate a specific case of parent organization (P749). I do not know why he/she did not define Inverse; may be because is a bad solution, but it does not matter. For me, the solution is a) create a specific inverse for P831 or b) assume that has subsidiary (P355) is correct as Inverse of P831, since it is – de facto – an organization. As already happens with participant in (P1344) as inverse of participant (P710) and participating team (P1923), the double inverse is an assumible constraint. I vote for the b) option. Thanks,Amadalvarez (talk) 12:31, 3 March 2019 (UTC) @Xaris333: Not necessary that we need to use parent club (P831). A subsidiary is specifically between organizations. Since we don't treat the team as an organization (the club is used for that) the relationship between team and club doesn't fit with subsidiary --Unnited meta (talk) 04:39, 4 March 2019 (UTC) UEFA ID for coaches Hello, I was wondering about the use of UEFA IDs for coaches. FIFA combine playing and coaching careers in their profile pages (FIFA player ID (archived) (P1469), example link here for Didier Deschamps (Q508711)), while Transfermarkt have separate profiles for someone's playing and coaching careers (Transfermarkt player ID (P2446) and Transfermarkt manager ID (P2447), example player and coach links for Carlo Ancelotti (Q174614)). However, UEFA use the same ID for someone's playing (UEFA player ID (P2276)) and coaching careers, however the information is displayed on different pages. For example, see the player and coach profiles for Ryan Giggs (Q10524). I wanted to add some of these UEFA IDs for coaches, but wasn't sure whether a new property should be created, it seems unnecessary to have duplicate values on items of players which became coaches. However, the URL scheme and scope of UEFA player ID (P2276) is currently meant for players. What would be the best solution? S.A. Julio (talk) 05:58, 2 March 2019 (UTC) Looks like we may need a new property for that, don't think there is a mechanism to use a qualifier of coach and player and then differentiate the url with $1=$2 etc --Unnited meta (talk) 04:39, 4 March 2019 (UTC) Legends should not end with full stop Recently a new constraint added to media legend (P2096).

(When summoned, they have been kept with the reasoning, consensus for deletion hasn't been reached either…) Lexeme or multilingual text, or even monolingual text would be definitely much better choice, but I'm afraid, too many users and too many robots have made their career on Wikidata on propelling the established misconception and it's practically impossible to change it now. However, if you're willing to try, you can count on my support.--Shlomo (talk) 10:19, 27 February 2019 (UTC) A lexeme exists in a certain language.

Currently, there are over 180000 uses of named after (P138), but only three of them are in lexemes.named by (P3938) is used only one time for lexemes.I think they should be used only for lexemes and for proper names. Why not including proper names in lexemes and limit the domain of these properties to lexemes?--Malore (talk) 00:21, 27 February 2019 (UTC) Are you saying that we should not have, for example ⟨ W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of America (Q7945187)    ⟩ named after (P138) ⟨ W. E. B. Du Bois (Q158060)    ⟩ ? Or that something with lexemes would somehow replace this? - Jmabel (talk) 02:29, 27 February 2019 (UTC) @Malore: Lexemes are for language-dependent concepts. named after (P138) is generally independent of language and should be at the concept level (items), not lexemes. Otherwise you would have the same relationship repeated for 300 lexemes (each language a proper name might be used in). ArthurPSmith (talk) 13:53, 27 February 2019 (UTC) @Jmabel: I'm saying we should: remove named after (P138)W. E. B. Du Bois (Q158060) from W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of America (Q7945187) because it doesn't talk about the organization but it talks about (one of) its name; create a lexeme for each name of the organization. In particular, one entitled \"W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of America\" with a sense that talks only about the name of the organization, and therefore containing named after (P138)W. E. B. Du Bois (Q158060) and WikiCFP conference series ID (P5127)W. E. B. Du Bois (Q158060) . In general, I think an item shouldn't contain statements about its name, which can be more than one or differ from language to language. Instead, each of these names should be represented by a lexeme.--Malore (talk) 14:01, 27 February 2019 (UTC) @ArthurPSmith: named after (P138) is not always language-indipendent. For example, Pascal's triangle (Q177051) can be named \"Pascal's triangle\" or \"Khayyam's triangle\" or \"Yang Hui's triangle\" or \"Tartaglia's triangle\", each of which is named after a different person. It's not so uncommon that the same thing is named after different people in different countries. Sometimes it's named after different persons even within the same country. --Malore (talk) 14:09, 27 February 2019 (UTC) That's not a matter of language, that's conceptual attribution (you yourself mentioned it's a regional, not lingual, issue), and it should still be at the concept level, just have the concept named after several different people. Such problems are quite rare. Otherwise we're replacing 180,000+ items with 54 million+ (?) lexemes! ArthurPSmith (talk) 14:17, 27 February 2019 (UTC) Because what you want for lexemes is derived from lexeme (P5191) anyway? Circeus (talk) 16:45, 27 February 2019 (UTC) @ArthurPSmith: What I propose won't \"replace\" any item and, although it requires to create lexemes, these lexemes should be created anyway: \"Pascal's triangle\", \"Tartaglia's triangle\", etc. have every right to be lexemes. What I propose is to move the statements involving named after (P138) from the item to the lexemes' senses. It obviously requires more work but it will allow to better understand which word is named after which entity. As for the regional vs lingual issue, it's not always true because January (Q108) is named after Janus (Q167685) in English, but it's named after ice (Q23392) in Czech.--Malore (talk) 21:00, 1 March 2019 (UTC) You can qualify the statement on the item to express this. If you develop some model for these, maybe there is use for L-entities for \"W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of America\", but if it's only to link to \"W.E.B. DuBois\" indirectly, I don't see an advantage. --- Jura 12:06, 3 March 2019 (UTC) Yes, we could use applies to name of subject (P5168), but I think it's conceptually wrong.

Is there an elegant way to record these facts in WD? - PKM (talk) 20:40, 2 March 2019 (UTC) Presumably name (P2561) is the main property we're looking for here. Perhaps field of work (P101) for an appropriate distinguishing qualifier? Jheald (talk) 21:20, 2 March 2019 (UTC) Interesting! It seems maiden name is typically represented with birth name (P1477) but pseudonym (P742) is usually used for a names used in a specific context (e.g. Hermann Hesse (Q25973) Mark Twain (Q7245)). Maybe use both and mark with field of work (P101) as @Jheald: suggests for pseudonym (P742)? That way it would be accessible to queries for people interested in either. -- ElanHR (talk) 20:12, 3 March 2019 (UTC) It's not really a pseudonym if it was her actual birth name / married name. So that's why name (P2561) seems to me more appropriate than pseudonym (P742). It would also be appropriate to have statements for birth name (P1477) and married name (P2562), but I would suggest also have the two P2561 statements. Jheald (talk) 01:18, 4 March 2019 (UTC) What seems right to me is new property “Professional name” = version of name used in a business or academic context, which will often be the version of the name used as the label (example J.R.R. Tolkien). - PKM (talk) 05:21, 4 March 2019 (UTC) I would support that. Jheald (talk) 10:52, 4 March 2019 (UTC) Linking to commons Hi. I often try to link Commons cats to wikidata items but when I try do the add wikidata can't find the category, even though the category has existed for some time. For example, I am trying to link Matthew Quashie Q16150053 to commons but get this error A page \"Matthew Quashie\" could not be found on \"commonswiki\". Any idea why this happens? Gbawden (talk) 08:52, 4 March 2019 (UTC) @Gbawden: Because c:Matthew Quashie does not exist but c:Category:Matthew Quashie does. The best thing to do is to add the property for Commons category and create a gallery page on Commons to link here. —Justin (koavf)❤T☮C☺M☯ 09:14, 4 March 2019 (UTC) I'm pretty sure that creating galleries on Commons just to link with Wikidata is a bad idea. Ghouston (talk) 09:17, 4 March 2019 (UTC) ? —Justin (koavf)❤T☮C☺M☯ 09:18, 4 March 2019 (UTC) Koavf Ok thanks that makes sense. Ghouston that wasn't my intention - I misunderstood what that linking was meant for Gbawden (talk) 09:21, 4 March 2019 (UTC) Speaking as a Commons admin: please don't create a gallery as a redirect just for Wikidata's convenience. You can (and should) sitelink the Commons Category page directly. - Jmabel (talk) 17:13, 4 March 2019 (UTC) If I add an image to a wikidata item the file name resolves quickly. However if I add a commons category the category name doesn't resolve, although if I hit publish it accepts and saves. Is this normal? Thanks Gbawden (talk) 09:32, 4 March 2019 (UTC) @Gbawden: It should do that if you add it as a sitelink ('Other sites' -> 'commons' -> add 'Category:X', and you'll get a pop-down list of matches), but it won't if you add it as Commons category (P373). Despite what @Koavf: said above, the best thing to do now is to add it as a sitelink, not as P373 unless the sitelink is already used by a gallery. That way the information from Wikidata can be used on Commons through the infobox there. Please don't create a new gallery unless it's actually needed and going to be maintained. Thanks.

ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 12:55, 4 March 2019 (UTC) What's going on with P1946 (P1946)? When this was originally proposed (and accepted with only two votes), there was no formatter URL. The one that has been added since is completely improper, as it has nothing to do with actual author records, but only book records. In fact, the numbers found in VIAF systematically correspond to individual works in that url, and not even works by those authors.Example 1: In the original property proposal, Philip Henry Wicksteed (Q2306330) is given as having the id vtls000036581, this is the record for the Irish version of a Children's book about Ancient China (the author of which has become entangled on Wikidata with Lustmord (Q913245), I have fixed the VIAF link, but it will take some work to properly disentangle them).Example 2: To Marianna O'Gallagher (Q3291272) was added the purported id vtls000086697. this correspond, again, not to O'Gallagher, but one of her books It is not, in fact a valid author record at all. The correct id as reported in VIAF is vtls000022718, and that corresponds to an edition of a play by Marina Carr (Q467609).Example 3: Even the property example on the property page itself is incorrect, because the correct id in VIAF is vtls000044446.I have deleted the formatter url from the property, as not only is it incredibly misleading, but the author records are not accessible online. I suspect many more authors that O'Gallagher are in the same situation of having a given record number that is incorrect.

If an Admin could have a look that would be great. Moebeus (talk) 19:16, 10 March 2019 (UTC) Done, protected for three months--Ymblanter (talk) 20:02, 10 March 2019 (UTC) Thank you! Moebeus (talk) 01:07, 11 March 2019 (UTC) This section was archived on a request by: Moebeus (talk) 01:07, 11 March 2019 (UTC) How to distinguish against events? I'm trying to find items near a given geographical point that are not events -- eg not 'happenings'.It used to be that I could exclude (or de-prioritise) items that were in the subclass tree of occurrence (Q1190554) to achieve this.But now I am finding chains like the following are breaking this assumption occurrence (Q1190554) phenomenon (Q483247) state (Q3505845) order (Q16513015) organization (Q43229) institution (Q178706) cultural institution (Q5193377) GLAM (Q1030034) museum (Q33506) national museum (Q17431399) and similarly for eg monastery (Q44613) --> organization (Q43229) etcSo: (i) do we think these are valid subclass of (P279) chains ?And (ii) how best now to distinguish/exclude true \"events\" -- ie things happening over a finite (short) duration -- from general items ? Jheald (talk) 22:54, 24 February 2019 (UTC) The most recent link in the chain above I think was organization (Q43229) --> order (Q16513015), by User:-xfi- on 27 January diff. This is what I think has joined up the chain, that has broken my query. It may have been based on reading a different sense of the word \"organization\". On the other hand, maybe it has a certain validity. Are there other links that should be questioned? Jheald (talk) 23:06, 24 February 2019 (UTC) That certainly strikes me as the weakest link in the chain. - Jmabel (talk) 00:31, 25 February 2019 (UTC) That link is certainly questionable, but I also question the chain which leads us from state (Q3505845), which seems to me to be associated with a certain stability and duration, to occurrence (Q1190554), which is specified to have has characteristic (P1552) = point in time (Q186408). The distinction would be useful to be able to draw, in our class tree, I think. Jheald (talk) 12:27, 25 February 2019 (UTC) It’s very possible state (Q3505845) is actually a metaclass, so should be left out of this class tree. Let « combat state » be the state of a military ship prepared for a fight (Real example in Wikidata if I recall). This « combat state » has instances in the real world, obviously, and can be characterized - weapons armed, crew ready … But imho it’s not a subclass of states, but an instance of state. A state is then not a subclass of events, but a class of events. This fits with the definition of a state : « denotes the presence of stable values of a set of variables of an object ». Combat state IS the set of variables of the ship. The « state » concept itself is a kind of events-class, it is instantiated by giving the characteristics of the instances of that event class - just like the « ship » concept is instantiated by giving an object that fits the characteristics of a ship. author TomT0m / talk page 12:54, 25 February 2019 (UTC) WikiProject Ontology has more than 50 participants and couldn't be pinged. Please post on the WikiProject's talk page instead. for input -- Jheald (talk) 12:29, 25 February 2019 (UTC) Why should phenomenon (Q483247) be a subclass of occurrence (Q1190554)? A phenomenon (Q483247) is not necessarily associated with any time. — Finn Årup Nielsen (fnielsen) (talk) 12:56, 25 February 2019 (UTC) The definition in english is « observable occurence », by this definition this is an event. On the frwiki article however we get a different definition « Un phénomène est la manière dont une chose, un fait du monde physique (objet, action…), psychique (émotion, pensée…) ou social (produit d'interactions sociales) se manifeste à la sensibilité d'un être vivant. » (a phonomenom is the way a thing or a physical (or social) fact manifests itself to a beeing sensitivity) which is definitely not the same. I’d say that then that it’s the same as for « state », « phenomenom » may be a metaclass. Watch a tree out of the window, you’ll feel twice the same tree, experimenting something similar if not identical. It seems reading a little more reading the frwiki article a little more that a « phenomenom » could be more precisely defined as a process in which a living entity feels the outside world. If instances of a process (say « jumping ») are events, « jumping » is a subclass of events. But not « process », which is a kind of events, a metaclass. So I’d best see « phenomenom » as a metaclass, but philosophical notions are always a challenge. author TomT0m / talk page 13:30, 25 February 2019 (UTC) It's not just this chain. I keep noticing subclass relationships on general classes that I do not agree with. I've learned to just live with them, to the point that I don't even record or remember them. If someone is interested in attempting to clean up the subclass hierarchy in Wikidata I'm motivated to participate. My first suggestion would be to require that general classes have a much better description, with examples and counter-examples, so that at least there is some guidance as to what correct and incorrect subclass relationships are. With the current level of documentation for general classes, it can be impossible to determine whether a subclass relationship on one of them is valid. Peter F. Patel-Schneider (talk) 12:54, 25 February 2019 (UTC) I removed \"order\" as a superclass for \"organization\", and added it separately under \"has quality\". I see a lot of people using the class hierarchy for abstract relationships like this when we have much more suitable properties. There's no reason to defer to something that doesn't make sense. ArthurPSmith (talk) 13:35, 25 February 2019 (UTC) I’m curious to know the rationale behind that statement. Is the « order » term used as a kind of synonym of the structure of an organization ? I can’t read the articles in which the term is defined. author TomT0m / talk page 13:49, 25 February 2019 (UTC) It seemed like a better relation - but perhaps there should be no such relation? I don't mind if somebody else removes it completely. The subclass of (P279) relation was certainly wrong anyway. I suspect the editor who added that was thinking of the meaning of the word \"organization\" as a state or condition, not the actual meaning of that entity as a class of groups of people etc. ArthurPSmith (talk) 17:02, 25 February 2019 (UTC) I agree with Peter F. Patel-Schneider. The problem seems to be that subclass relationships are added on an adhoc basis whenever somebody thinks it's a good idea. This is the Wiki way after all. But unfortunately they don't always verify that every instance of the subclass is also an instance of the parent class. I'd suggest that an improvement would be to discuss the reasoning for the relationships in detail in the Talk page for each item, and then watch the item to revert changes that aren't consistent with the reasoning, at least without further reasoning. Ghouston (talk) 22:17, 25 February 2019 (UTC) We probably also need regression tests. These would be particular queries that are expected to return certain results. Ghouston (talk) 22:41, 25 February 2019 (UTC) Perhaps it would be useful if we had a central {{Wikidata list}} (or equivalent) for the upper ontology, which users could add to their watchlists to monitor changes to the items (and use the history to find the order of changes), and other lists for specialized ontologies for each Wikiproject which could be monitored there. --Yair rand (talk) 22:53, 25 February 2019 (UTC) {{Wikidata list}} could also be used to construct regression tests: you'd just have to add the output page to your watchlist. Ghouston (talk) 23:10, 25 February 2019 (UTC) I created the page Wikidata:WikiProject Ontology/Top-level ontology list to show the top two levels of the ontology, the theoretical fundamentals as stored on Wikidata. It's ... pretty bad. :( --Yair rand (talk) 02:26, 28 February 2019 (UTC) Yeah, and improving it would involve a multitude of struggles, on a case-by-case basis. Ghouston (talk) 21:36, 28 February 2019 (UTC) A lot of the entries are colours, I think I can do something with those. Ghouston (talk) 21:45, 28 February 2019 (UTC) @Ghouston: Be sure to discuss with User:ArthurPSmith before wading in too quickly re colours. It's been quite a contentious area in the past. Jheald (talk) 21:48, 28 February 2019 (UTC) Still, they can be subclasses of color (Q1075) instead of subclasses of entity (Q35120) ... it seems to me. Ghouston (talk) 21:53, 28 February 2019 (UTC) Well, nothing is easy. What does the item color (Q1075) represent? Enwiki says \"colour (Commonwealth English), is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color categories, with names such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple.\" So it's a \"characteristic of human visual perception\", but maybe we'd need another item to represent the colours themselves. Or perhaps color (Q1075) should represent the colours and there are other items like color vision (Q374259) to represent the mechanism. Ghouston (talk) 22:04, 28 February 2019 (UTC) @Ghouston: User_talk:ArthurPSmith#Colors_as_subclass_of_entity?. --Yair rand (talk) 22:33, 28 February 2019 (UTC) I see you've already been over the exact subject, and it shows how obscure these discussions can get. I'd imagine having a particular item representing the range of possible colours (at least such colours as we'd want to describe with items), with a colour like \"red\", actually a range of colours, being a subclass, and a \"pure\" colour, an item representing a \"single colour\" that can't be divided, being an instance. Ghouston (talk) 22:54, 28 February 2019 (UTC) @Ghouston: Relevant: Wikidata:Requests_for_comment/Are_colors_instance-of_or_subclass-of_color. I'm not even sure if distinct \"single colors\" are things that can exist. Or maybe all the colors are pure/indivisible colors, but just somewhat ambiguous which one it is? Interestingly, the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology has Red instance of PrimaryColor subclass ColorAttribute subclass VisualAttribute, but Emw mentioned that BFO uses subclass all the way. Maybe splitting the colors into range items and pure-color items makes sense. (Notifying @ArthurPSmith: of this discussion.) --Yair rand (talk) 23:49, 28 February 2019 (UTC) Uh, yes, it gets complicated. I think starting at the top level is the wrong approach - it's much easier to think about relationships at a more concrete level, and even with something seemingly as simple as color is actually quite tricky. As I just noted on my talk page, I think treating colors as classes may have been wrongheaded, and we should handle them more like the way we handle locations. Locations have natural hierarchies which we capture in wikidata with various properties like located in the administrative territorial entity (P131). Perhaps we need a special property for color space that works similarly - or maybe a generic property like facet of (P1269)? Using subclass of (P279) to represent this hierarchy seems to be definitely quite confusing. ArthurPSmith (talk) 16:00, 1 March 2019 (UTC) It's hard to work out whether or not colours should have a subclass hierarchy, and how to construct a hierarchy. However, it doesn't seem to me that individual colours deserve to be near the top-level item in the ontology. Maybe the best thing for now would be to make each colour item an instance of color (Q1075), as many already are, and remove any subclass statements. At least they will be grouped together and can be enumerated with a simple query. Ghouston (talk) 08:00, 3 March 2019 (UTC) Alternatively perhaps make the top level of colours a subclass of qualia (Q282250) ? Jheald (talk) 10:08, 3 March 2019 (UTC) That would be color (Q1075) itself. Colours are subjective, but in response to particular a physical phenomenon, so colours can be standardised and measured and so forth. Ghouston (talk) 10:15, 3 March 2019 (UTC) Don't think so. Every case of a colour in the class \"red\" is a case of a qualia. So that looks more like a subclass relationship. It may also be a case of a physical phenomenon. Items can combine more than one class heritage. Jheald (talk) 10:29, 3 March 2019 (UTC) I don't think that the idea of colour subclasses is wrong, although building a good hierarchy of colours would be difficult because there are different schemes for defining and naming colours. You can start with a statement like \"red is a colour\", which gives an idea of what the \"colour\" item is going to be: the class of all possible colours. So red (Q3142) is an instance of color (Q1075). But then if you read the Wikipedia article about red, it confirms that red is a colour, but it turns out there's a whole range of reds, each of which can also be described as colours. Some are defined from the colours of chemical compounds, some from colour standards, some may be pretty vague. So it also makes sense to say that red (Q3142) is a subclasss of color (Q1075). Ghouston (talk) 10:57, 3 March 2019 (UTC) If you declare that A is an instance of B and also a subclass of B you must be either conflating two different meanings in the item \"A\" or in the item \"B\"; in this case I think the conflation is between \"red as a color\" and \"colors perceived as reddish\" as a class of colors. As to the \"top of the class hierarchy\" issue - I think this is a pretty meaningless criterion. If you look at computer programs (java say) in practical use, huge numbers of classes are at the \"top of the class hierarchy\" because it's not useful to define them as subclasses of anything else. It's not wrong or a problem, just the way the world is. At least that's my view. But I wouldn't be opposed to a more general color class representing \"all of colorspace\" or something like that if it made sense. ArthurPSmith (talk) 14:27, 4 March 2019 (UTC) Maybe perception (Q160402)   is a better item, less close to the philosophical definition problem. Both can be done, a specific colour seems to be a qualia-class to me. ⟨ visual perception ⟩ subclass of (P279) ⟨ perception ⟩ - ⟨ human visual perception ⟩ subclass of (P279) ⟨ visual perception ⟩ - ⟨ (human) color perception ⟩ subclass of (P279) ⟨ Human visual perception ⟩ (because of course bees do not perceive the colours the same way humans do- ⟨ Red ⟩ subclass of (P279) ⟨ (human) color perception ⟩ . The « colour » property associated to this hierarchy could then be labelled « perceived by human as colour». If we want to then have a « colour » class, it should be a perception meta-class. This item would be described as « a class of visual sensation that humans gives names to, by which they can characterize objects or lights. » Anyway there is a lot of aspects of colours (blue-light for example is different from blue-light qualia, a blue object is also something different), so a « one size fits all » approach may be doomed to fail. Also it would be a shame to avoid the hierarchy issue when it seems there is a natural colour hierarchy. A classification of light rays according to their wavelenght (X-ray, visible light, infrared …) is definitely something doable. Of course then « red light » is naturally a subclass of « visible light ». Of course it’s a little bit more complicated if there is a combination of different wavelenghts like in the light emitted by a star of in « white light » (enwiki: « White light, a combination of lights of different wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum »). Another item funny item I found HTTPS://WWW.WIKIDATA.ORG/WIKI/Q375479 To sort this mess, I think I important question is « what do we want to achieve, what are our use cases ? » Do we want to describe paintings with colours ? Describe star lights ? Both ? Why should we have only one colour property ? author TomT0m / talk page 10:59, 3 March 2019 (UTC) This is why we have abstract concepts like \"colour\", so that we can talk about colours as a general concept and not have to deal with each colour individually. So whatever a colour is declared to be, we can declare it on color (Q1075), and then declare individual colours to be instances or subclasses of that. Ghouston (talk) 19:39, 3 March 2019 (UTC) @Ghouston: There is a definition of color (Q1075) : « visual perception of light wavelengths … » (english description) and it’s no more no less abstract than any other concept. I don’t think we can use this as a catch all item for anything related to the colour domains as we like. So I don’t think your suggestion, if I understand it correctly, is of any help to sort anything out. author TomT0m / talk page 12:38, 4 March 2019 (UTC) \"Visual perception of light wavelengths\" is really the definition of color vision (Q374259). How do you define \"a colour\"? It will involve some subset of visible light. It's true some statements about particular colours may not apply to all colours, so can't be put directly on color (Q1075). In some cases the statement may be unique to that colour, in other cases there may be a subclass of colours, such as colours of a single hue, monochromatic color (Q6901438). Ghouston (talk) 20:18, 4 March 2019 (UTC) ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ A useful reference here might be the Getty AAT color hierarchy, which distinguishes \"colors (hues or tints)\" and \"color (perceived attribute)\".

As far as I understand, he believes it is redundant because Category:Boidae (Q7149834)category's main topic (P301)Boidae (Q45556) + Boidae (Q45556)instance of (P31)taxon (Q16521) and such statements clutter view for human being, who might decide to edit such items manually. I think that having P4224 statements on as many category items as possible reflects current community consensus and simplifies both writing SPARQL queries and manual editing. We don't have to rigorously follow database normalisation (Q339072) here, some verbosity is good. @Infovarius: believes that category contains (P4224)taxon (Q16521) +parent taxon (P171) as qualifier are useful and supported by reasonator. Other members of Taxonomy project were not particularly interested in this discussion, so I am trying to get opinions of wider audience here. --Ghuron (talk) 08:49, 1 March 2019 (UTC) I must admit that I did intentionally not participate in the discussion, but I have read it. As far as I am concerned, I agree with Brya that we should be reluctant in adding data that can be constructed from existing data-chains. So I have serious doubts as to if category contains (P4224) improves our structured data. I can understand the SPARQL-argument, but IMHO we don't build our database for SPARQL. Having said that, you can conclude that I am not really into the community consensus on category contains (P4224). Lymantria (talk) 11:34, 1 March 2019 (UTC) @Lymantria: can you please elaborate more on what kind of doubts you have regarding P4224? --Ghuron (talk) 16:19, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Well, let me try the obvious example: the claim of ⟨ Category:Insects (Q5608148)    ⟩ category contains (P4224) ⟨ taxon (Q16521)    ⟩ is about the elements of that catogory being taxa. But nl:Categorie:Insect for instance contains sterile insect technique (Q1462045) and insect hotel (Q1664398), both not being taxa. Lymantria (talk) 17:06, 1 March 2019 (UTC) @Lymantria: I do not see how does this relates to redundancy. You are right that Category:Insects (Q5608148) should not have P4224 statement (thus I reverted my edit). I certainly can verify if there are any non-taxon items, that belongs to the category, and, if so, do not add P4224 --Ghuron (talk) 13:38, 4 March 2019 (UTC) As per Lymantria, a big issue is how categories are used on different language Wikipedias. Even for plants on the English Wikipedia, where we try hard to separate \"taxonomic\" categories from more general ones, it's not possible to persuade all editors that this is correct, and there are many \"mixed\" categories like the nl one above. Only yesterday I altered en:Category:Fagopyrum and en:Category:Buckwheat so that they were distinct, but this may not have consensus, and will probably get changed back. So I do rather support Brya's point. Peter coxhead (talk) 20:55, 1 March 2019 (UTC) @Peter coxhead: I agree that different wikis has somewhat different ideas about criteria for inclusion articles in the categories mentioned above (and many others). But the issue for >4M items will not disappear once we declare it. We might want to capture and express this criteria in wikidata and allows local wikis to display it. P301 is certainly step in the right direction and Template:Cat main (Q6383110) can use it. I've also seen some categories in uk-wiki (couldn't find it now), that were using P971 statements to describe criteria, but I strongly believe that P4224 is more appropriate way to express it. For instance, when I (incorrectly) add Category:Insects (Q5608148)category contains (P4224)taxon (Q16521) and if en:Category:Insects would be displaying header like The main article for this category is Insect. The category should contains instances of taxon, exceptions are possible as rare values may exist, people would notice this and revert my edit. Alternatively, if they see that majority of categories are dedicated to taxons, they will extract other categories to separate element. --Ghuron (talk) 13:38, 4 March 2019 (UTC) I sympathize with @Brya:'s desire to simplify things and not needlessly duplicate information however category contains (P4224) and category's main topic (P301) serve different semantic purposes and should not be considered redundant. category contains (P4224) typically defines a Wikimedia category (Q59542487) whereas category's main topic (P301) is typically used to provide context and applies to all category types even those serving administrative functions (e.g. Category:Wikipedia administration (Q2944611)). Additionally even in cases where category's main topic (P301) can be used to infer a set category (as it appears to be in the case for taxon (Q16521)) the conversion to category contains (P4224) statement is often context dependent and requires information not captured in category's main topic (P301). For example: Category:Marie Curie (Q6898030)category's main topic (P301)Marie Curie (Q7186) however this does not imply Category:Marie Curie (Q6898030)category contains (P4224)human (Q5) as would be implied if we use the same rule as in the taxon (Q16521) example. Category:Astronauts (Q6990046)category's main topic (P301)astronaut (Q11631) however this statement does not imply Category:Astronauts (Q6990046)category contains (P4224)profession (Q28640) but rather Category:Astronauts (Q6990046)category contains (P4224)human (Q5)occupation (P106)astronaut (Q11631) . Category:German people (Q3919754)category's main topic (P301)Germans (Q42884) becomes Category:German people (Q3919754)category contains (P4224)human (Q5)country of citizenship (P27)Germany (Q183) . (Edit: fixed a typo saying the country was Germans (Q42884) rather than Germany (Q183)) While the approach using category's main topic (P301) may work with the current structure of taxonomic categories, it does not scale well to other domains. category contains (P4224) provides a way to specify the necessary information needed to define most category memberships while not requiring an editor to know SPARQL. -- ElanHR (talk) 00:07, 3 March 2019 (UTC) As arguments go, this is not very convincing: Category:Astronauts (Q6990046)category's main topic (P301)astronaut (Q11631) does imply \"category contains instances of human with profession astronaut\", since \"profession\" is a property limited to cases of \"human\". A matter of writing one's software properly. Category:German people (Q3919754)category contains (P4224)human (Q5)country of citizenship (P27)Germans (Q42884) is even worse as an example because it differs from the item in accepting only one kind of Germans, while the item accepts two kinds of Germans. Category:German people (Q3919754)category's main topic (P301)Germans (Q42884) , if queried properly, would be more accurate. Brya (talk) 15:14, 3 March 2019 (UTC) @Brya: Wikidata UI displays a single item \"as is\" and does not have to do it differently depending on whenever it is human, taxon or wikimedia category. Major wikidata consumers such as infobox modules, google knowledge strip (graph), siri/alexa/cortana, etc do some preprocessing such as filtering/joining/aggregation/etc. They also do not want to have different processing for items depending on their P31. They value uniformity over redundancy and it is not a \"matter of writing one's software properly\". It is cost of access to data, and if its too high, the data will not be used. --Ghuron (talk) 13:38, 4 March 2019 (UTC) In my experience there are different kinds of infoboxes for different topics. In that case it is no hardship to make sure that the infoboxes read the information correctly. Commercial sources such as siri/alexa/cortana can afford to write their software properly, although they would prefer to slide by without making an effort. - Brya (talk) 17:46, 4 March 2019 (UTC) @Brya: Whoops - definitely had a typo in my 3rd example (meant Germany (Q183) instead of a Germans (Q42884)) thank you for pointing that out - I've fixed in the original. I totally agree that in some cases 'main topic' can be used (with appropriate domain knowledge) to infer the set definition reasonably well. That said I still believe category contains (P4224) provides a much more natural and scalable way of doing so. Perhaps an argument that would sit with you better would be cases where constructing an appropriately descriptive 'main topic item' would itself be unnatural. For example: Category:Hindu poets (Q8514421) (could be easily modeled as Category:Hindu poets (Q8514421)category contains (P4224)human (Q5)religion or worldview (P140)Hinduism (Q9089)occupation (P106)poet (Q49757) + Category:Hindu poets (Q8514421)category contains (P4224)human (Q5)occupation (P106)poet (Q49757) ) Category:1963 disestablishments in Kenya (Q24990592) Category:1810 songs (Q7937783) Note: As part of my project:Conflict of interest (Q4663309) I will mention that I have a relationship with Google (Q95). That said, data normalization helps everyone! As you pointed out, larger institutions have the resources to deal with these issue but properly structuring data allows hobby developers like @Ghuron: (and myself) to create consistency checks as well as import information that has been already human-curated in the form of structured categories. Cheers, ElanHR (talk) 05:21, 5 March 2019 (UTC) If nothing else, your third example shows that adding an extra, redundant shell brings extra risks of introducing error. Your \"Category:Hindu poets (Q8514421) (could be easily modeled as Category:Hindu poets (Q8514421)category contains (P4224)human (Q5)religion or worldview (P140)Hinduism (Q9089)occupation (P106)poet (Q49757) )\" is a case where there isn't a \"category's main topic\" so seems to be out of scope for this discussion. As with everything, data normalization can be overdone. It depends entirely on one's perspective if a further degree of normalization is helpful; in practice data normalization often enough loses information and introduces error. - Brya (talk) 12:14, 5 March 2019 (UTC) Mass revert? My bot made some unfortunate edits (unexpected statements removed, code is now fixed so it won't happen again). Can someone easily revert ~2800 revisions with these revision IDs please? They should all be the latest edit on the respective item, at this moment.

(um ping wird gebeten) W!B: (talk) 18:12, 1 March 2019 (UTC) PS: übrigens schaff ich es auch nicht, ein zweites alias einzugeben. beim erstellen steht \"Aliasse, mit „|“ getrennt\", aber wir geht das beim datenobjekt? (Q1776351) W!B: (talk) 20:01, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Ich nehme an, es geht um das Änderung von Bezeichnungen, Beschreibungen, und Aliasse (hier zusammengefasst als \"Begriffe\"). Es gibt da im Grunde zwei Möglichkeiten: Du hast Javascript aktiviert, und wartest bis die Objekt-Seite vollständig geladen ist. Dann kannst Du mit dem \"bearbeiten\"-Link direkt über der Box mit den Begriffen den Bearbeitungsmodus direkt auf der Objektseite aktivieren. Dabei kannst Du alle Sprachen bearbeiten, für die bereits eines der Felder ausgefüllt ist (ggf. \"In weiteren Sprachen\" klicken), oder die Du standardmäßig angezeigt bekommst (siehe hierzu auch weiter unten in diesem Kommentar). Bei dieser Methode brauchst Du keine \"|\"-Separatoren für Aliasse, da immer hinreichend viele Felder angezeigt werden. Ohne Javascript wirst Du zum Bearbeiten auf die Seite Special:SetLabelDescriptionAliases/Q1776351 geleitet, um Begriffe zu bearbeiten. Da steht auf der Seite dabei, in welcher Sprache Du bearbeitest, und das ist meines Wissens dieselbe Sprache, die Du für die Benutzeroberfläche ausgewählt hast. Typischerweise wird das mit dem \"Universial Language Selector\" ausgewählt, der im Vector-Skin rechts oben neben dem Link zu Deiner Benutzerseite zu finden ist. Das dürfte das \"menu at the top of the screen\" sein. Alternativ kannst Du mit bspw. Special:SetLabelDescriptionAliases/Q1776351/fr zum Beispiel die französischen Begriffe mit deutscher Benutzeroberfläche verändern, oder neu setzen falls sie noch überhaupt nicht existieren. Bei dieser Methode gibt es nur ein Feld für Aliasse, die entsprechend mit dem Separator \"|\" getrennt werden müssen – siehe auch Special:SetLabelDescriptionAliases/Q1776351/de im aktuellen Zustand. Letztlich noch ein Kommentar zu den standardmäßig für Dich angezeigten Sprachen: das wird aus irgendeinem Grund so ausgewählt, wie Du babel-Boxen auf Deiner Benutzerseite hast. Ich nehme also an, dass Du zurzeit deutsche und englische Begriffe angezeigt bekommst, und alles andere versteckt wird. Korrekt? Viele Grüße, —MisterSynergy (talk) 20:24, 1 March 2019 (UTC) danke dir, das hilt. ja. mit Special:SetLabelDescriptionAliases/Q1776351/la (das wollte ich) hats geklappt. ich hab Javascript natürlich an. und ja ich kann alle sprachen bearbeiten, für die bereits eines der felder ausgefüllt ist. nur, wie leg ich eine neue sprache an? oder geht das sowieso nur mit Special:SetLabelDescriptionAliases? und wenn dem so ist, wärs doch nett, den link dort zu deponieren. jedesmal Javascript ein/aus, sprache umstellen oder den link händisch eintippen ist ja auch nicht lustig. (PS: bei \"alias hinzufügen\" hab ich mich übrigens nur patschert angestellt. W!B: (talk) 20:57, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Es gibt unter Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-gadgets ein Gadget \"labelLister\". Wenn Du das aktivierst, bekommst Du zwischen den Tabs \"Lesen\" und \"Versionsgeschichte\" (im Vector-Skin) einen weiteren Tab mit einem separaten Begriffe-Tool. Das braucht auch Javascript, aber da kannst Du dann auch einen Sprachcode ohne bereits definierte Begriffe angeben und dann entsprechend etwas ergänzen. Etwas anderes fällt mir gerade nicht ein… —MisterSynergy (talk) 21:09, 1 March 2019 (UTC) tut mir leid, aber das zeigt auch nur die schon eingegebenen sprachen (und das \"NEW ! : Change several language in one fell swoop (go to beta version).\" schickt mich nur wieder zum eingabefeld) ich würde dich jedenfalls herzlichst bitten, das irgendwo auf der passenden hilfeseite zu vermerken (ich kann ja nicht der erste sein, der damit kämpft), und einen bugreport zu machen: es würde auch reichen, wenn ich irgendwie standardmässig \"alle sprachen\" bekomme: ich kann ja auch den italienischen namen einzugeben fähig sein, ohne italienisch zu können (googlen reicht). da hält uns wer für zu dumm ;) W!B: (talk) 23:22, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Hier klappt das mit der älteren Version von labelLister durchaus. Wenn ich auf den Tab klicke kommt ein Dialog eingeblendet, dort auf \"edit\" bzw. \"Bearbeiten\" klicken. Dann ist da ein Eingabefeld, wo ich einen Sprachcode eingeben kann (zum Beispiel \"hu\" für Ungarisch), auch solche die noch keine Begriffe haben. Klappt das auch nicht? Mir ist leider keine vollständige Liste der Sprachcodes bekannt, allerdings sollte Help:Wikimedia language codes/lists/all für die allermeisten Anwendungsfälle reichen. —MisterSynergy (talk) 07:14, 2 March 2019 (UTC) MisterSynergy: ah, jetzt geht der labelLister: steht als \"Liste der Bezeichnungen\" ganz oben zwischen \"Lesen\" und \"Versionsgeschichte\". ich hab wohl nicht genug neu geladen nach dem freischalten, sollte ich eigentlich wissen ;). danke dir für mühe. W!B: (talk) 12:08, 5 March 2019 (UTC) Way to model a gift (Q707482) In this example: Domestic Scene (Q18510574), the subject of the item has been given to the museum that still owns it. This is currently modelled with significant event (P793) and the givers are qualified with participant (P710). I would like to explicitly mention the receiver(s) for such statements. How should this be done? Are there gift examples anywhere? Thanks in advance. Jane023 (talk) 11:05, 2 March 2019 (UTC) We have donated by (P1028), currently 3370 times as a main statement and 2963 as a qualifier. Does this fit the need? Jheald (talk) 15:51, 2 March 2019 (UTC) Interesting thanks! I didn't know about that, but it works for the giver. I am still looking for the receiver. See e.g. Dutch Gift (Q1165096). Jane023 (talk) 09:28, 4 March 2019 (UTC) Reception will often be implicit in the start date of a collection (P195) statement, which would implicitly identify the receiver. But I can see things may get more challenging if there is a lengthy chain on provenance that we are seeking to record, more than just the final gift to the current collection. Although, on the other hand, an item can have many collection (P195) or owned by (P127) statements, each with a start date and end date. Jheald (talk) 10:58, 4 March 2019 (UTC) Well I was thinking more generically, not just for collections, but to pinpoint a gift in time and place with giver(s) and receiver(s). Donated by works, but received by is needed. Jane023 (talk) 17:34, 5 March 2019 (UTC) sugar substitute (Q626292) and sweetener (Q4368298) I think that most of labels and interwikis of sugar substitute (Q626292) actually mean sweetener (Q4368298).

(Or is it just my set up?)Editing just now, I keep getting \"technical error - timeout\" edit messages the first time I try to make an edit. If I try to make the edit again, the second time it usually works; but this shouldn't be happening. Are other people getting this too, or is it just me? Jheald (talk) 14:38, 5 March 2019 (UTC) Candidate for elected office Is there a standard way we show someone was a candidate for an elected office without creating, say, 50 \"candidate for Governor of state X\" entries? If we created the categories would it also list the winner of the election or just the losers? --RAN (talk) 20:54, 1 March 2019 (UTC) The usual way seems to be to create one item per election (often created anyway for Wikipedia), then each person can be listed with candidate (P726). E.g., 2012 South Korean presidential election (Q82241) Ghouston (talk) 04:15, 2 March 2019 (UTC) There's also the inverse approach, using candidacy in election (P3602) on the person, pointing at the election item. --Oravrattas (talk) 08:26, 2 March 2019 (UTC) Just what I was looking for ... thanks! --RAN (talk) 21:51, 5 March 2019 (UTC) This section was archived on a request by: Ghouston (talk) 00:10, 12 March 2019 (UTC) P53 (family) Property:P53 is set to contain only a single value, but isn't every noble woman that marries into a noble family a member of two noble families? She would be a member of her parental family and after marriage a member of her husband's noble family. How should this be handled? Looking at various examples they tend to be a mix of the parental family and the family they marry into. Is it meant to only be genetic (parental family)? --RAN (talk) 05:16, 4 March 2019 (UTC) Like Isabella Teotochi Albrizzi (Q5454), for example. That one could be fixed by marking start/end time qualifiers as separators in the constraint. But the setup on that item assumes that somebody ceases to be a member of a family when they marry into another family, which seems doubtful. Ghouston (talk) 05:59, 4 March 2019 (UTC) No, it doesn't make that claim, only the first married family has an end time. I added start/end time as permitted qualifiers on family (P53), and as separators on the single-value constraint, that should be enough to handle it? Ghouston (talk) 06:35, 4 March 2019 (UTC) Should we remove the restraint that it contain a single value? Half the entries will give an error if we assume half of the noble family entries are female. --RAN (talk) 06:49, 4 March 2019 (UTC) Just give a start date for the second family and the constraint should be satisfied, even if it's <unknown value>. Ghouston (talk) 07:09, 4 March 2019 (UTC) @Ghouston: How do I add in a null value, does it have a Q code? --RAN (talk) 18:04, 5 March 2019 (UTC) See Help:Statements#Unknown or no values. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 19:10, 5 March 2019 (UTC) Isabella Teotochi Albrizzi (Q5454) has a tricky name: her surname is being written \"Teotochi Albrizzi\", which is her birth name Teotochi, which is Greek and normally written in English as Theotokis, but in this case with the Italian spelling, along with the surname of her 2nd Italian husband Albrizzi. I'm not sure how to set this up in Wikidata such that it will sort properly in Commons. Ghouston (talk) 07:15, 4 March 2019 (UTC) I suppose you create a special family name item just for her.

I fully understand the reason why but it is an awful practice. It is bad enough to only say \"researcher\" when it is a psychologist, a microbiologist or whatever.The objective is disambiguation. As automated descriptions are superior anyway, it follows that disambiguation is done best by adding statements that distinguish one person/item from another. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 07:44, 2 March 2019 (UTC) Wikidata is a WIP project, isn't it. I believe these items are going to be better and better. I am currently working on items of young Polish scientists who quite often are only an item with ORCID ID. There probably should be a list of these items (or a Wikidata project) to work on. Kpjas (talk) 08:03, 2 March 2019 (UTC) 195k items with an ORCID iD (P496) statement have three or even fewer statements (which are 42% of all items with an ORCID iD (P496)). There is quite a lot to do, I guess. —MisterSynergy (talk) 08:14, 2 March 2019 (UTC) @MisterSynergy: The task looks overwhelming but... please compare [6] and Mateusz Adamiak (Q61101679). I am busy on items like this. Kpjas (talk) 08:48, 2 March 2019 (UTC) I am working hard to bring authors and papers together like I just did for Mateusz Adamiak. I follow this up with work on co-authors that are evident in the Scholia for an author. This is however beside the point. The point is that descriptions identifying people with a number is not acceptable. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 10:07, 2 March 2019 (UTC) I don't think these items are of much use. For most cases, the easiest is probably to just ignore them. The query suggested by MisterSynergy can be used to filter them. --- Jura 12:20, 3 March 2019 (UTC) Many of these items have dozens, some even hundreds of links to scholarly papers. So there is a use for them it will evolve over time. There has been for a month or so adding employment info for scholars. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 13:59, 4 March 2019 (UTC) I've adjusted dozens of these descriptions to be more natural; however I don't see any problem with them as interim descriptions for people. ArthurPSmith (talk) 14:33, 4 March 2019 (UTC) So you are perfectly happy for me to ask what people find about this outside of Wikidata? Really? Thanks, GerardM (talk) 14:35, 4 March 2019 (UTC) A survey would be a great idea, if that's what you're suggesting? ArthurPSmith (talk) 19:39, 4 March 2019 (UTC) As an \"outside\" user of Wikidata information, I prefer the description to be a plain, natural-language phrase that can be shown to an end user without provoking bafflement and confusion. Hence, while I sympathize with the problems this is trying to solve, I don't think we should be subverting the description to include identifiers in this way. Cheers, Bovlb (talk) 05:39, 5 March 2019 (UTC) @Bovlb: Hmm, I'm not sure what you mean by \"subverting the description\". These are newly created items, so there was no description for them before. What would you suggest as \"the description\" that should be used to help disambiguate them? ArthurPSmith (talk) 19:08, 5 March 2019 (UTC) @ArthurPSmith: I used the word \"subvert\", not because some prior value is being displaced, but because it seems to change the purpose of the description in a way which interferes with the established use case I described above. As to what I would suggest, I have looked at several cases and I agree that coming up with a good description is not easy, especially when all we have is an ORC_ID. The uniqueness constraint (\"no two items can have both the same label and the same description\") is going to make it harder and harder to generate useful descriptions automatically as Wikidata grows. The current work to import publications is putting pressure on person entities in this regard. We also see it when trying to add descriptions to geo-locations. Cheers Bovlb (talk) 19:27, 5 March 2019 (UTC) The purpose of the description is to disambiguate the item label; that much is clear from sentence 1 of help:description, so it is a stretch to describe such disambigation as subvertion. The purpose of the description is not to describe the subject of the item; that's what item property statements are for. Expecting or relying on the description to decribe the item subject is a category error, easily made but nontheless wrong. --Tagishsimon (talk) 23:43, 5 March 2019 (UTC) Please disjoin en:Margin of error and ru:Предел погрешности Let's look at en:Margin of error.

Btqfshfst (talk) 17:14, 27 February 2019 (UTC) @Btqfshfst, Fuzheado: That Harry Potter is a fictional human is already implied by the statement instance of (P31): wizard in the Harry Potter universe (Q15298259) (as wizard in the Harry Potter universe (Q15298259) is a subclass of fictional human (Q15632617)). So there is no need to add additionally instance of (P31): fictional human (Q15632617). I suppose that this was the reason for the removal. If there is no reason to keep this statement nonetheless, I would remove it again. - Valentina.Anitnelav (talk) 19:58, 27 February 2019 (UTC) Thanks, I don't feel strongly one way or another - just make sure we are consistent. -- Fuzheado (talk) 20:08, 27 February 2019 (UTC) So are there no non-human wizards in the Harry Potter universe? (I don't know the books well enough to know the answer.) - Jmabel (talk) 02:58, 28 February 2019 (UTC) @Jmabel: Correct, other species can't be wizards in the series. --Yair rand (talk) 03:09, 28 February 2019 (UTC) Si if I understand correctly Yair rand (do you have a reference, I easily remember non-human doing magic but not that their called \"wizard/witch\"), then, we should revert this removal Special:Diff/867421525 and this adding Special:Diff/211825515 (both by Infovarius who strangely hasn't been pinged yet). Cheers, VIGNERON (talk) 08:21, 1 March 2019 (UTC) So it looks like in the Harry Potter universe non-humans are not allowed to have wands but it looks like half-humans can be wizards? I don't know how people want to model this in relationship to fictional human (Q15632617) vs fictional character (Q95074) *shrug*[7] -- ElanHR (talk) 05:38, 3 March 2019 (UTC) Hm, I forgot about the case of half-humans. Assuming we don't count half-human as a subclass of human, then each human-wizard item should also have instance of (P31) fictional human (Q15632617). If we do count them as humans, then the additional statement is unnecessary, and wizard in the Harry Potter universe (Q15298259) should have subclass of (P279) fictional human (Q15632617). --Yair rand (talk) 04:48, 4 March 2019 (UTC) Thank you. I'm happy I was patient enough to wait and not take further erroneous actions Btqfshfst (talk) 20:31, 6 March 2019 (UTC) Edit action feed (Android app) Background: Our readers mainly read the wikis on mobile phones; our editing tools are focused on desktop and keyboards. This will be a problem for us: Wikipedia and thus the Wikimedia wikis became a big thing because everyone who read it could add information. If this is not true in the future, we’ll have a harder time getting new editors. The developers are working on a number of different solutions, including, of course, trying to make the kind of typical content creation that we’ve always done easier on mobile. However, we’re also looking into if there are specific tasks that could be specifically well suited for mobile users. And Wikidata is of course not only one of these things, but also important for the future in general.Users in the Android Wikipedia app will be invited to an edit action feed, where they’ll be fed Wikipedia articles in their chosen language and be asked to add Wikidata descriptions, where these are lacking, or translating existing descriptions. This will only be shown to editors who have made at least five unreverted Wikidata description edits in the app; the translations require fifty unreverted edits. If an edit gets reverted, the the count starts at zero again. This is an anti-vandalism measure: we don’t want to invite people to specifically do this unless they’ve shown basic competency at this kind of editing. You shouldn’t need to worry about an uncontrollable influx of edits since this only affects a subset of the Wikipedia Android app users, but we’ll be monitoring the stats to make sure everything’s going well. All Android app edits can be found with the Android app edit tag.If you’ve got any comments or questions, the best place to leave or ask them is probably talk page on mediawiki.org. We aim to launch this towards the end of March. /Johan (WMF) (talk) 10:40, 6 March 2019 (UTC) @Johan (WMF): This sounds like a good idea. Moving forward I think it would be great to trigger edit actions when a user moves to a location who's GPS signal is linked to a Wikidata item. ChristianKl ❪✉❫ 16:07, 6 March 2019 (UTC) Suggestion noted. (: /Johan (WMF) (talk) 17:58, 6 March 2019 (UTC) Linking a person to the index of their personal archive How should I best model the relationships described on this page? https://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/manuscriptsI can represent that fact that a person has archives in this collection with Darrell A. Posey (Q5224576) -> archives at (P485) -> Pitt Rivers Museum (Q1456119). I'd like to connect the individuals to the index pages of their archives, e.g. Darrell A. Posey (Q5224576) to https://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/posey-papers . I see that we have personal archive (Q27032347) which could be used with described at URL (P973) or official website (P856) but that seems to refer to institutions, and in the present case \"archive\" practically means a box of papers, or a collection of boxes. Thanks in advance for any suggestions. MartinPoulter (talk) 12:08, 6 March 2019 (UTC) Would creating a property for \"finding aid URL\" (or similar) be appropriate here? It could thus be a qualifier on archives at (P485), or a primary property on items about a collection. Otherwise, I'd recommend described at URL (P973) as a qualifier on archives at (P485), though I don't know if the constraints would allow it. Andrew Gray (talk) 12:51, 6 March 2019 (UTC) described at URL (P973) as a qualifier sounds like a good solution, because then we can distinguish between links to an online digital archive (full work available at URL (P953)) and links to a description or index (described at URL (P973)). MartinPoulter (talk) 14:14, 6 March 2019 (UTC) It's a bit confusing/misleading, because when editing the items for archives at (P485), described at URL (P973) is one of the suggested qualifiers. However entering the URL (which clearly does describe the archives), gives the message \"The property described at URL should not be used in this location (as qualifiers). The only valid location for this property is as main value.\". Oh well I think I'll just ignore the non-issue. Animalparty (talk) 05:55, 7 March 2019 (UTC) Help with complex constraint I would like to create a constraint on has part(s) (P527) such that a certain qualifier is allowed only if the value of the main statement is a class, not an instance. e.g.:Marder I (Q156927)has part(s) (P527)turret front armor (Q38554489) , with qualifier slope (P4184)33 degree — qualifier is allowed, because turret front armor (Q38554489) is a class.Memphite necropolis (Q10334749)has part(s) (P527)Pyramid of Unas (Q1478801) , with qualifier slope (P4184)56.3 degree — qualifier is not allowed, because Pyramid of Unas (Q1478801) is an instance of a class.Thank you! Swpb (talk) 16:25, 6 March 2019 (UTC) @Swpb: Done, added to the property. (Currently there are only two violations, both because gun shield (Q4096972) is erroneously structured like a non-class.) --Yair rand (talk) 21:34, 6 March 2019 (UTC) Please help with reviewing property proposals It would be great to have a bit more activity on property proposals - quite a lot of them are left open for many months, with few people chiming in to give their opinion. Here is how you can help: Vote on open proposals to help them reach a consensus (big thumbs up to David who tirelessly voted on most proposals for the last few years I think); Help mark mature proposals with |status=ready when you see a clear consensus for creation (you can do that for your own proposals too!). At the moment the bulk of this work is done by ArthurPSmith alone - if we have other people doing that (for instance in other timezones), properties will get created more swiftly. Mark stale, inactive proposals with no consensus as |status=not done (or |status=withdrawn if it is your own); Don't forget to ping relevant wikiprojects, that generally helps attract eyeballs. A good place to look for properties to review is Wikidata:Property_proposal/Overview - this table makes it easy to find recently proposed properties or old inactive ones that probably need closing.The property proposal process can be a bit daunting when you see piles of old proposals full of unresolved heated debates, or properties that only created many months after being proposed. If the reviewing is more efficient, more newcomers will hopefully be keen to submit proposals. This is a space where key decisions about Wikidata's structure are made, so it's really worth getting involved. This is also rewarding work - you get to think about interesting data modelling problems, it is quite creative! − Pintoch (talk) 21:54, 6 March 2019 (UTC) @Pintoch: I had no idea I could update the status myself. Happy to help. From observation, tt seems that a proposal should be open for at least 7 days before being marked \"ready\" - is that right? - PKM (talk) 22:32, 6 March 2019 (UTC) @PKM: See Wikidata:Property creators for current policies, including the \"no less than one week\" rule. ArthurPSmith (talk) 22:52, 6 March 2019 (UTC) (Note: I recently-ish proposed on the talk page to extend that time to a bit longer than a week.) --Yair rand (talk) 22:55, 6 March 2019 (UTC) Subclasses and parts (@Verdy p:.)See Talk:Q58416391.

Anyone want to weigh in? --Yair rand (talk) 22:53, 6 March 2019 (UTC) Litre per year Hello. In Nesjavellir Power Station (Q693330), how do I add product or material produced or service provided (P1056) as \"litre per year\" or at least \"litre per day\". I think I'm close, but can't seem to figure out how to add the period. Is a new property required here? Rehman 10:50, 7 March 2019 (UTC) @Rehman: You need an item for the unit - check whether it already exists, but if not you can create \"litre per day\" as an item and use that as the unit for the quantity. ArthurPSmith (talk) 16:11, 7 March 2019 (UTC) Thanks, ArthurPSmith. I created litre per day (Q61992237), litre per month (Q61992243), and litre per year (Q61992246), by basing on the similar existing litre per kilogram (Q57175557). The items will be used for entities in the geothermal power and cogeneration industries, among other areas. Rehman 16:39, 7 March 2019 (UTC) They look good, thanks. ArthurPSmith (talk) 16:44, 7 March 2019 (UTC) Alternative text for images Hello. Just like how we could state media legend (P2096) for image (P18), do we have a way to set alternative text for images? Rehman 11:30, 7 March 2019 (UTC) We do not - see the discussion around a previous proposal for this here: Wikidata:Property proposal/text alt. ArthurPSmith (talk) 16:12, 7 March 2019 (UTC) Well that's a pity. Your last comment there made a lot of sense. Too bad it wasn't passed. Rehman 16:24, 7 March 2019 (UTC) Image metadata is about to launch on Commons, another attempt can be made then. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 17:11, 7 March 2019 (UTC) Not really. None of the developers seem to understand the difference between a caption and alt text, even when it's explained to them. --RexxS (talk) 22:54, 7 March 2019 (UTC) Typography of labels Hi,Ludo29 raised an interresting question on the French Project chat (Topic:Uvhpolh1k8ylvkjt) : how to indicate that a label in one langage is foreign to this langage? (and consequently that when reused, it should often be in italic). The item concerned here is Teachta Dála (Q654291) but it applies to many other items.The first idea was to put wiki syntaxe directly inside the label. It kind of works for Wikimedia projects but could make a mess for re-use outside of Wikimedia projects so I think it is a bad good idea. Maybe it can be solved with a specific property or something else (Lexemes?) but I'm not sure how.Does anybody has an idea or a solution for this?Cheers, VIGNERON (talk) 13:58, 7 March 2019 (UTC) Yes. This is an important question. If a word is usually displayed, in a given language, in italic, and if we decide to maintain our labels here wikicode-free, then we need some place to store the type of display that we are expecting to see whenever that word is used. It can be stored on Wikipedia but it seems to me that even if this is monolingual stuff, it should be here. Unfortunately, we can't use statements that would use items such as italic (Q344098) as values, for there are names or titles that can require both italic for one part and nothing at all for the rest. The value should thus mimic some kind of wikicode. Thierry Caro (talk) 14:16, 7 March 2019 (UTC) It's an intractable problem for labels. In French or Spanish, you see Q344098's label as \"Teachta Dála\" which could be rendered (for example on enwiki) as something like \"{{lang|ie|Teachta Dála}}\". However in English we see the label as \"Deputy to the Dáil\", where the only foreign word is \"Dáil\"; so it would have to be rendered as something like \"Deputy to the {{lang|ie|Dála}}\". In Welsh, we see the label \"Dirprwy y Dáil\", so we would render it as \"Dirprwy y {{lang|ie|Dála}}\", and so on. Labels are free text and may be a mixture of local and foreign languages, so there's no way of demarking which parts of a label are to be rendered as foreign. The best you could do would be to create a new property of datatype monolingual text that allowed some sort of markup to be included that indicated the foreign part, for example, <Teachta Dála> (fr); Deputy to the <Dáil> (en); etc. (with a qualifier having the value \"ie\"). That sort of duplication of labels just for use on other Wikiprojects is something we probably ought to reach some consensus on. --RexxS (talk) 23:22, 7 March 2019 (UTC) \"Field of work\" and \"Interested in\" General question: how do you distinguish field of work (P101) and interested in (P2650)? For organizations, writers, and historians, I've been using \"interested in\" (1) for very specific topics (field of work = history of costume; interested in = Ancient Greek clothing) and (2) for hobbies/interests outside of the subject's professional life. But the property proposal for \"interested in\" says it should be used only for the most general concepts ... which is how I use \"field of work\". How do you use these properties? - PKM (talk) 20:25, 4 March 2019 (UTC) Your logic makes sense to me. interested in (P2650) seems woefully vague, arbitrary, and redundant. What's the basis for inclusion? if Angela Merkel (Q567) said in an interview she was interested in hiking or stamp collecting, should that sort of trivial detritus flood Wikidata? How about interested in Germany? Alternately, it stands to reason, and is likely verifiable that a lepidopterist would be interested in Lepidoptera, lepidopterology, entomology, biology, and maybe moths or Actias luna (Q135289), and also have the field of work (P101) lepidopterology, entomology, biology, taxonomy, etc. None of this matters, add whatever you want. -Animalparty (talk) 05:05, 9 March 2019 (UTC) Questions about correlating Wikipedia titles and Wikidata IDs [I'm new to this chat page. If there's a better place to ask this sort of question, please let me know.]I believe one of the first uses of Wikidata on the Wikipedias was to properly systematize interwiki language links. I always assumed this was done by having a template somewhere in each Wikipedia article containing its Wikidata ID, and then machinery somewhere used that Wikidata ID to look up the names of the articles in other language Wikipedias on the same topic. But that's evidently not the way it's done: I don't see Wikidata IDs in Wikipedia articles anywhere. (And indeed they'd be a nuisance to maintain, and subject to vandalism.)So I guess that when displaying interwiki language links, a query is first done to discover the Wikidata ID corresponding to the original article's name. Am I correct?Anyway, that's by way of background. I've been wanting to look up Wikidata IDs corresponding to Wikipedia article names myself. I finally constructed this SPARQL query: "@en;
