Graham87 (talk) 10:31, 28 September 2022 (UTC) Since they are no longer living, and would not be involved in self promotion, and would have an obituary online, shouldn't they get a Wikidata entry under their real name? --RAN (talk) 16:32, 29 September 2022 (UTC) Thank you for the notice; I’ve added him to WD:Deceased editors and updated his user page. If someone who knew him better wants to update his obituary, please do. Galaktos (talk) 13:31, 3 October 2022 (UTC) Purpose of non existent entities? What is the purpose of non-existent entities such as Q111015181 and Q111023369? I could understand if they were vaporware or proposals for the future, but some of these details seem to come from thin air.PS: I'm not sure if it's possible to close an RFC, but I goofed by misunderstanding what that meant and initially posting my question there. Is it possible to request the closure of an RFC created in such a way? Thanks. Mbrickn (talk) 04:14, 3 October 2022 (UTC) They make sense to me. For example it is possible for there to be articles about PlayStation 6 (Q111015181) even though they don't exist. Here is one. They also serve as placeholders for eventual items when they presumably become a thing. BrokenSegue (talk) 05:00, 3 October 2022 (UTC) It makes sense to have items for things that are likely to exist, I agree. But I'm not sure why PlayStation 6 (Q111015181) has a mass (P2067) statement — surely that's not known yet? Sam Wilson 05:48, 3 October 2022 (UTC) This is basically what I'm saying. Some of the other details don't make sense either, like the inclusion of the PS3 GPU and CPU in the RSX and Cell, the publication date, and the price. Mbrickn (talk) 11:17, 3 October 2022 (UTC) I've deleted Q111023369 under WD:N. It had no sitelinks or references of any kind. — Martin (MSGJ · talk) 06:42, 3 October 2022 (UTC) I have deleted your errant RFC. Another time you might consider using {{Delete}}.

Read the full report · Unsubscribe · Mohammed Sadat (WMDE) 13:37, 4 October 2022 (UTC) Representing how politicians vote I think the voting record of politicians is an incredibly important point of data.In NZ Parliament, each bill goes through three readings, where parties vote on bills (or if it's a conscience vote, politicians independently vote). If it passes all three readings, it becomes law.If I wanted to represent which politicians voted for and against the a particular bill (for example Fair Trading (Soliciting on Behalf of Charities) Amendment Bill (Q113945916) at each of its three readings), is there a way this could be represented? Is there a \"voted for\" and \"voted against\" property? I can see votes received (P1111), but this appears to be for counting amount of votes received, rather than individual votes received.How might this be structured? One vote might be easy enough with simple \"voted for/voted against\" properties with a value for each politician, but there are three votes for every bill. Would you need an item per reading of the bill? And detail the vote there?Any experience/examples of recording the voting history of politicians would be appreciated. Supertrinko (talk) 23:10, 2 October 2022 (UTC) tracking voting is hard (there are lots of votes on lots of things) we should probably start with more modest ambitions. like just tracking all legislators with external IDs to vote tracking websites that already exist. I don't think we currently have the properties you suggest. BrokenSegue (talk) 15:33, 3 October 2022 (UTC) Unfortunately, the only vote tracking website in NZ is voted.nz, and that is specific to conscience votes only. Realistically, the only true record of votes is in Hansard (Parliamentary verbatim spoken record). So if NZ wants a true record of voting, a database needs to be established. I'm already going to be going through old hansard digitising old content, so I'll be placing voting information in a database anyway, I may as well look towards collecting it in a way that it'll be compatible with wikidata. I think a generic yes/no for/against vote would be easy enough to structure and could be used across a multitude of use cases. Supertrinko (talk) 20:50, 3 October 2022 (UTC) Ah, I was thinking more U.S. centric where a number of databases exist. If there are no existing databases what sources do you plan to use as references for the statements? Sounds like you plan to create your own database by digitizing content. I'm not opposed to trying to store vote data on wikidata but I think it's really tricky. BrokenSegue (talk) 21:20, 3 October 2022 (UTC) NZ stores our votes in the official parliamentary record, what we call \"Hansard\". Essentially detailed minutes of debate in parliament. And at the bottom of each debate, it will record the votes on the bill in plain text format. Not very machine readable at all. So yeah, it'll definitely be tricky and unfortunately will simply require manually recording votes from those minutes/hansard. Supertrinko (talk) 03:31, 5 October 2022 (UTC) Heuristic references I've asked for some thoughts over at Help_talk:Sources#Heuristic_references - briefly, what guidance should we have about when and how to use heuristics like inferred from image (Q105573271) (responses there ideally to keep them together). T.Shafee(evo&evo) (talk) 23:11, 5 October 2022 (UTC) Modelling of buildings with multiple uses over time Most heritage buildings have had multiples uses over time. These various uses can be documented in the same Wikidata item, as in Sanderson Centre for the Performing Arts (Q38386517) or in Aeolian Hall (Q4687855). This modelling strategy seems to work relatively well but it requires to qualify most statements with start and end times. At the same time, this may also present challenges with properties such as date of official opening (P1619) (that may apply to the initial opening or to a reopening after a closure and renovations) or architect (P84) (that may apply to the architect of the initial construction or to the renovation). My questions follow... Fjjulien (talk) 02:59, 4 October 2022 (UTC) Are there circumstances where it would be better to have two distinct items representing different usages of the same building at different points in time? If renovations are made to the exterior of the building and it's no longer the same architectural structure? If the interior of the buildings is profoundly renovated? For example, I stumbled upon The Registry Theatre (Q110374281) and The Registry Theatre (Q56285771), which represent the same building on the exterior, although with renovations in the interior. Is there a justification for keeping these two items separate or should they be merged? Fjjulien (talk) 03:14, 4 October 2022 (UTC) I think these two can be merged (if they indeed represent the same building). Please be careful not to merge institutions and buildings, but in this case both theatre building (Q24354) and land registry building (Q30310495) are buildings, not institutions/organizations. Vojtěch Dostál (talk) 09:32, 4 October 2022 (UTC) @Vojtěch Dostál As per your suggestion, I documented both uses of the building within Q110374281, which I then renamed as \"The Registry Theatre\" to reflect the most common name that the building is known as today. I also kept the other item, Q56285771, which I modelled as a performance hall (Q112688641) (i.e., a performance space within the building) with its own attributes that are distinct from the building's. This dual modelling approach matches OpenStreetMap, where the performance space is represented as a node and the building as an area. Fjjulien (talk) 03:21, 6 October 2022 (UTC) @Fjjulien Yes. That wasn't exactly my suggestion but it makes sense. Sometimes venues may be considered just a part (eg. a room) of a building. Vojtěch Dostál (talk) 06:00, 6 October 2022 (UTC) Under which circumstances should structure replaced by (P167) and structure replaces (P1398) be used? The examples provided seem to suggest that these properties are to be used when a building has entirely ceased to exist (it was burned down or demolished) and a new building was erected in its location. Is this indeed the case or could these properties also be used when a building is substantially renovated to serve another purpose?
