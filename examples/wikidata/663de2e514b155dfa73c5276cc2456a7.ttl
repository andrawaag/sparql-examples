I regularly wonder what the structure means and increasingly I find the whole classification thing something that I cannot make head or tail out. Why all the intermediate steps and does it make sense to anyone? Thanks, GerardM (talk) 13:11, 29 November 2016 (UTC) I find the structure quite appropriate. What is your issue with it?--Micru (talk) 13:45, 29 November 2016 (UTC) This structure means that people who are instance of (P31) President of Haiti (Q3290543) are also instance of (P31) president (Q30461) and automatically but it's not required to add president (Q30461) again.ChristianKl (talk) 16:15, 29 November 2016 (UTC) though we do not classify people that way, all people in wikidata are instance of (P31) human (Q5), see for example Michel Martelly (Q57512). President is designated by position held (P39). So President of Haiti (Q3290543) should not have any instances. However I'm not sure what GerardM is proposing to do differently here? ArthurPSmith (talk) 17:28, 29 November 2016 (UTC) Yes, my example was bad. President get's designated by position held (P39). ChristianKl (talk) 18:03, 29 November 2016 (UTC) I see that subclass of (P279)head of state (Q48352) got removed from the item, probably because president (Q30461) already has that statement. However, according to the various Wikipedia articles, some presidents aren't the head of state. Sjoerd de Bruin (talk) 19:04, 29 November 2016 (UTC) My issue is that the structure is something that I find contrived, I do not understand it it is not something that I expect can be explained in a logical way. It is a mess. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 05:46, 30 November 2016 (UTC) The structure of thinking in terms of classes and instances comes from Computer Science. Do you find the skos basic ontology less contrived? ChristianKl (talk) 23:09, 30 November 2016 (UTC) That sounds like \"it is legacy\" and therefore sacrosanct. If it cannot be explained to people like me, what is the point? Thanks, GerardM (talk) 05:32, 1 December 2016 (UTC) Party secretary property and items I want to update the information about party secretary on some articles about political parties on Wikipedia (mainly in infoboxes). Since the information is outdated on some places, Wikidata is of course the best way forward. But there seem to be some \"confusion\" about the properties and some items here. When I try to add a new statement, and begin typing \"party secretary\", I get the property \"party chief representative (P210)\". But that seems to specifically refer to a leader in a communist party in many cases (languages and descriptions). On Wikidata there are the items \"party secretary (Q836971)\", \"party secretary (Q25712839)\" and \"Committee secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (Q988456)\". On English Wikipedia there are \"Party secretary\" and \"Party Committee Secretary\". Can someone help to give some advice on how to clear this out? /PatrikN (talk) 01:07, 30 November 2016 (UTC) Generally, this is done the other way around: Individuals have statements using position held (P39) to link to the position, with qualifier of (P642) to the organization (if no specific . --Yair rand (talk) 01:42, 30 November 2016 (UTC) Often but certainly not always. There are many items where there is an item for the specific position eg maharaja of Anwar. Thanks, GerardM (talk) 07:31, 30 November 2016 (UTC) Thanks for the reply, but it really doesn't answer my question and as I understand, Wikidata is not bidirectional, so it have to be done both ways. But I found an interesting discussion from when the property were created I think (here). There Zolo says \"I am not quite sure about the scope (individualize by country ? Extend to non-communist countries ?\" and that is exactly the case now, why I bring it up, since here in the Nordic countries where I live almost all parties have a party secretary and that has nothing to do with communism. It might be best to call the property party chief representative, but then the labels and descriptions should be changed I think, to be more general and eventually only mention communism as an example or subclass. Likewise party secretary might just be seen as a subclass of party chief representative. Apart from that, I think some of the items I mentioned shall be merged. Lastly, since there have been some discussion about this before, I don't know if this it the best place to discuss this, or e.g. the property talk would be better. /PatrikN (talk) 13:51, 30 November 2016 (UTC) If you want to say that the leader of Social Democrats (Q212101) is Mette Frederiksen, chairperson (P488) sounds like the relevant property. party chief representative (P210) is something different. It is not supposed to be used on items about parties but on items about a territory or an organization. For example, there is a Communist Party secretary for Shanghai or a Communist Party Secretary in Peking University. It is the guy who represents the party there. Such a thing exists in communist countries, I think it existed in fascist countries. In Democratic countries you may have a leader of the Democratic Leader for California or for Harvard, but that does not work the same way and I don't think this property should be used for these cases. -Zolo (talk) 14:32, 30 November 2016 (UTC) Well, then I think a new property should be created, since the usage in Democratic countries are quite different, even though they relate in some way. On Wikipedia there are also two different articles, where e.g. Party secretary is described as \"a senior official within a political party with responsibility for the organizational and daily political work with responsibility for the organizational and daily political work\". Looking at Socialdemokratiet at the Danish Wikipedia (or the local article for some other party in the Nordic countries), there is the chairperson/leader, then two Deputy leaders in this case and then party secretary ( Partisekretær ). Looking at pages that link to party chief representative (P210), it's almost just about communist countries, so there should not be much work in changing anything that should be related to the new property. Will it be possible to restrict the use of P210 to what you described and/or can it be possible to restrict the new to be used in relation to political parties and as a property for persons (holding this position)? I think it should be created with labels just like party secretary (Q836971). Shall I do it or will you do it? And shall there be links between the item and property? /PatrikN (talk) 15:30, 30 November 2016 (UTC) We need or, or a few properties, to describe the leader of an organization, but I don't really see the need for a specific new property for political parties. There are so many different cases, and so many imaginable labels that it sounds like an unending task. I think we should rater use ageneric property like chairperson (P488) that can apply to political parties as well as other types organizations, and add qualifiers like Social Democrats (Q212101)chairperson (P488)Mette Frederiksen (Q5015)subject has role (P2868)party secretary (Q836971) . -Zolo (talk) 09:00, 1 December 2016 (UTC) Using external IDs as redirects to Wikidata items Is there a standalone tool that makes it possible to use external IDs as \"redirects\" to Wikidata items? Using the GND ID (P227) \"116814683\" to link to the item Ernst Graf (Q15892138) for example.

It's neither a part (a physical part ? what would be the sum of all the part ? The sequence of all championship?) nor a subclass (what would be its instances?). We have Help:BMP who provides guidelines on what instance of and part of means. But you're right that there is a series of actual competition and that we should provide a way to model this, if possible consistent across different domains. Maybe we should create a \"series of england football national championship\" with ⟨ series of england football national championship ⟩ has part(s) of the class (P2670) ⟨ Premier League (Q9448)    ⟩ ⟨ 2016–17 Premier League (Q23009701)    ⟩ series Search ⟨ series of england football national championship ⟩ series ordinal (P1545) ⟨  25 ⟩ . The rationale is that an event can appear in several series and that the number in the series depends of the series we consider. So we must bind the number with the series (it's a ternary relation for the mathematicians or computer guys amongs us) and the right way to do this is to put everything in a single statement. author TomT0m / talk page 20:56, 28 November 2016 (UTC) @TomT0m: So I must create items like \"series of Premier League\" for each league of each country?

The Olympics part of http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/ was taken offline yesterday. The effect here is being discussed at en:Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Olympics#Warning on http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/ closing down and migrating and Property talk:P1447. There are over 50k, maybe 85k, now broken links to that dead website.We now can either just sit back and wait to see what they create at the new, upcoming IOC site next year, and then try to migrate our links via a bot or similar, or we could be proactive, and get someone, high up the WMF/WD/WP management food chain who knows about bots and WikiData, to be involved/aware of the new site setup so that the transition could be more seamless and less painful. The-Pope (talk) 15:20, 2 December 2016 (UTC) Seems to be still online at the moment. Archive.org has at least some copies of their records so we can replace the link with an archive.org link if it really goes away. ArthurPSmith (talk) 15:46, 2 December 2016 (UTC) Bill Mahon of Sports-Reference has commented in this enwiki thread, and what he says is quite promising since he seems to care about our problem. In my opinion it would be the best to tell him what we need for migration; I could imagine that if they provide a mapping between old and new identifiers(or URLs) we’d already be on the safe side. I also guess it would be useful to start with the ~95.000 Wikidata items with Sports-Reference identifiers, and modify Wikipedia links soon thereafter. —MisterSynergy (talk) 17:25, 2 December 2016 (UTC) Archiving the properties for deletion page Sections at Wikidata:Properties for deletion which have been marked as resolved for more than a few days need to be archived.

Hi all. I'm trying to add coordinates for some articles that don't currently have them either here or on Wikipedia. What's the best way of finding coordinates for the articles, and importing them to Wikidata? I know using Google Maps for this is not an option due to copyright. At the moment I'm using OpenStreetMap, e.g. [1], but I gather that this might have problematic copyright as Wikidata's CC-0 license means we're not following OSM's CC-BY license? But then, shouldn't the same problem also be true for coordinates imported from Wikipedia? Thanks. Mike Peel (talk) 13:04, 4 December 2016 (UTC) I don't know about other countries, but in the US, facts cannot be copyrighted, only the expression of facts. If you went into Google Earth, looked visually at an item of interest, and read off the coordinates of the center of the item, the resulting coordinates would be a fact, not expression, and not subject to Google's copyright. Can you give a link to the policy, discussion, etc., which makes you think we can't look up coordinates on Google Maps? Jc3s5h (talk) 15:20, 4 December 2016 (UTC) In Europe there are database rights, which I understand are an issue, particularly with Google Maps. See https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Collaboration_with_Wikipedia#Importing_geodata_from_Wikipedia . Thanks. Mike Peel (talk) 19:11, 4 December 2016 (UTC) If you look at the area with Google maps and don't copy the specific coordinate of a city like Berlin that Google uses but use any coordiante that's right, I don't think you would violate Google's suis genesis database rights.

Thanks, GerardM (talk) 12:06, 5 December 2016 (UTC) I tend to agree (coincidental similar opening due to edit conflict!). At the very least any proposal to deprecate these properties should come with a solid plan to migrate to the new property (probably bot-assisted). Adding the (deprecated) label to such a highly visible property doesn't reflect well on the project. To a casual visitor to one of our items this would probably not instill much confidence in our ability to responsibly curate their possible future edits/work on here. Also, \"But the plans were on display...\", they were indeed at the RFC page and now I remember I indeed visited it. But the opinion seemed to be very much split at the time of my visit. It is indeed listed on the Watchlist as well, but I know my eyes are trained to scan and select the information I want from that page and neurologically we are probably effectively blind to such other additions to the page. I would support a more visible process for proposals (properties, RFCs, etc.) that are about to close. Instead of closing a property, maybe it could be marked instead, starting a deadline of a couple of days during which it is advertised even more clearly (e.g. using colour on the Watchlist) or by notifications one can subscribe to. --Azertus (talk) 12:20, 5 December 2016 (UTC) At the time I created the property and posted in Bot request there were 8 votes in favor and 2 against (included my own in against). I didn't close the RfC because there still open discussion about father/mother and stepfather/stepmother. ChristianKl (talk) 13:27, 5 December 2016 (UTC) P625: Why is 60 seconds possible?

Matěj Suchánek (talk) 17:18, 5 December 2016 (UTC) Personifications Could I get some advice on personification, please. Two instances: Anna Livia (Q27957442) (which I confess right now conflates a couple of different concepts, a fictional character from Finnegans Wake, and the personification of the River Liffey), and 'La Pepa', by & large the female personification of the w:en:Spanish Constitution of 1812.It would be useful to have items for both Anna Livia in its personification sense, and for La Pepa, since they give rise to the naming of the Anna Livia Bridge (Q4767235) and the La Constitución de 1812 Bridge (Q6464357), and both of these will benefit from an appropriate named after (P138). Per Anna Livia (Q27957442), I understand we have a value anthropomorphism (Q132987), but how do we say what the item is a personification of? Do we use named after (P138) in the Anna Livia (Q27957442) item to point to Liffey (Q208009) and named after (P138) in a to-be-created 'La Pepa' item to point to Spanish Constitution of 1812 (Q1421412). Or what? thanks --Tagishsimon (talk) 10:35, 5 December 2016 (UTC) Allowed values constraintAre we missing an \"allowed values constraint\"? To be used on properties as follows:⟨ constraint status (P2316) ⟩ property constraint (P2302) ⟨ allowed values constraint ⟩ item Search ⟨ Q21502408 ⟩ I'm also not sure which property should go in the place of \"item\" (class (P2308)?). I'm probably missing something obvious here, so apologies in advance.By the way, I got led into this rabbit hole by checking if the qualifier constraint status (P2316) could be used with any other value besides mandatory constraint (Q21502408). The answer appears to be no, but this is not yet reflected by a property constraint, hence the above question.ETA: I believe there might need to be a \"non-mandatory constraint\" item as well. At least Template:Constraint:Type has a mandatory=true switch, the absence of which can't be modeled as of yet? --Azertus (talk) 14:52, 5 December 2016 (UTC) Wikidata weekly summary #238 Here's your quick overview of what has been happening around Wikidata over the last week.

For example http://collectie.boijmans.nl/nl/bmimage/2880x1620/2981.jpg Should we use described at URL (P973) with instance of (P31) is image (Q478798)? Or should we per museum create a property and save the objectid that is converted to the image? Or are external links to copyrighted images prohibited within Wikidata? --Hannolans (talk) 16:40, 6 December 2016 (UTC) I would link to http://collectie.boijmans.nl/nl/object/2981 using described at URL (P973) and not deep link to the file. I don't think these file deep links are very stable and what is exactly the use case for these deep links? Somehow embedding external images in the representation of a Wikidata item?

Zdravljica (Q169215) and Zdravljica (Q27965845) have been merged twice today, but if you look at the content, these are completely different items. Both are Slovene songs, and they have the same title, but the lyrics and authors are different. --EncycloPetey (talk) 20:02, 5 December 2016 (UTC) You can link the two items with different from (P1889) to make clear that they aren't the same. It would also make sense to add more statements such as author (P50). ChristianKl (talk) 21:09, 5 December 2016 (UTC) If you can find a way to add a site link for the same language in both that will prevent the merge (for example if each has a page linked in the slovenian language wiki). ArthurPSmith (talk) 21:13, 5 December 2016 (UTC) @ChristianKl: Thanks. I tried to find something like this, but the software never offered this when I searched. @ArthurPSmith: That would only be possible if I knew enough Slovene to go looking for the different texts, could understand the publication data, and thus add the new text at the Slovene Wikisource. Unfortunately, I do not know Slovene well enough to do that. --EncycloPetey (talk) 02:04, 6 December 2016 (UTC) I haven't tried these \"games\" that causes these merges, but it definitly look like they need a \"yes, I know what I am doing\"-button @ArthurPSmith: That didn't stop Grimsta (Q4356886) and Grimsta (Q2608131) from being merged. -- Innocent bystander (talk) 07:36, 6 December 2016 (UTC) Whatever these \"Games\" are, they're responsible for more problems than just incorrect merges. Several times now, I've seen them responsible for adding Britannica On-line ID \"links\" to articles where either (a) no such article exists at Britannica on-line, or (b) the wrong article title was linked. --EncycloPetey (talk) 08:55, 6 December 2016 (UTC) @Innocent bystander: You added the \"different from\" statement after the merge, so it's not really a surprise that the statement could not prevent the merge. If you would have added it before, it would have, simply because you cannot merge items that link to each other already. --YMS (talk) 14:58, 8 December 2016 (UTC) @YMS: I responded to User:ArthurPSmith. The two items about a place called \"Grimsta\" both had a svwiki-sitelink, but were still merged. Both also had good P31-claims that could have helped identify them as two different subjects. The only things they have in common, is the spelling of their names (I doubt they are pronounced the same) and that they are located in Stockholm County, Sweden. -- Innocent bystander (talk) 15:21, 8 December 2016 (UTC) Wow so \"Distributed Game\" \"Merge items\" just threw out the incompatible sv link without a second thought? That seems quite dangerous - who's responsible for it?

Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 15:52, 9 December 2016 (UTC) Stained glass versus stained glass windows We have stained glass (Q1473346) and it seems to cover everything related to stained glass: stained glass as a material, stained glass as an artistic technique, windows and other objects made using stained glass... Sometimes it's used with instance of (P31) to say that an item is a stained glass window, sometimes it's used with made from material (P186) to mean that something is made from stained glass. Some of the labels seem to mean the material, others seem to specifically mean windows. It all seems to be a bit of a mess.I think the right thing to do is to split it because a stained glass window is a type of window (made of stained glass) and searching for windows should find stained glass windows too, but stained glass as a material isn't a type of window, so it doesn't make sense to use the same item for both things. A while ago I made stained glass window (Q21061279), but that's unfortunately as far as I got.The sitelinks on Q1473346 that I can understand are about stained glass in general, so I think the labels which specifically mean a window should be moved to Q21061279 (along with any statements and sitelinks which are specific to windows), but I'm not sure which those are. Can anyone help me clean this up?(@Oursana: pinging you in case you're interested or want to comment :))- Nikki (talk) 21:24, 9 December 2016 (UTC) As happens very often the site links do not fit exactly. One has also to consider whether stained glass (Q1473346) only means the technique, not the material. As the technique is broadly used with windows this project could be about both, as are many site links. The sitelinks are at least not all about stained glass in general, de is about stained glass windows, for what we habe no special word. Glasmalerei means the technique which is only used with church windows, so I would not split. Same with en:work=window and material. fr:Vitrail is very similar to en and does not mean the window in it it is the window and not the technique in nl it is colored glass, not the technique, not a window.

I want to establish whether a train station is used for both passenger and freight traffic or only one of those. The best I could come up with is connecting service (P1192) with freight train (Q954927) and/or passenger train (Q1363599). Does anyone use any other method?--Strainu (talk) 00:06, 11 December 2016 (UTC) instance of (P31) train station qualifier: of (P642) passenger transport (Q2072431)--Oursana (talk) 02:30, 11 December 2016 (UTC) I wouldn't use connecting service (P1192) because freight train (Q954927) and passenger train (Q1363599) aren't instances of train service (Q16323955). Either use a qualifier like Oursana suggested or create two new items \"passenger railway station\" and \"freight traffic station\" and use them instead of railway station (Q55488). --Pasleim (talk) 18:07, 11 December 2016 (UTC) Second solution. the of (P642) qualifier is undefined. We should instead (I think we discussed that but don't remember when or if a proposal occured) create a property about the kind of stuff a vehicle carries. This would give something like ⟨ freight train ⟩ subclass of (P279) ⟨ train ⟩ ⟨ freight train ⟩ has quality Search ⟨ object or value ⟩ kind of carried stuff Search ⟨ freight ⟩ ⟨ freight traffic station ⟩ type of vehicle Search ⟨ freight train ⟩ . I'll propose the necessary properties. author TomT0m / talk page 19:13, 11 December 2016 (UTC) It seems that those two properties fits partly : designed to carry (P3349) and item operated (P121) . author TomT0m / talk page 19:18, 11 December 2016 (UTC) Actually there is a property proposal for what is actually carried : Wikidata:Property_proposal/people_or_cargo_transported.

Do we have a relevant help page? —MisterSynergy (talk) 08:49, 11 December 2016 (UTC) There is reason for deprecated rank (P2241) for deprecated statements. But I don't see any dead link item yet. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 09:08, 11 December 2016 (UTC) Thanks, this is what I was looking for. Current uses can be identified by this query. I’ll manage to find something suitable. —MisterSynergy (talk) 09:34, 11 December 2016 (UTC) @MisterSynergy: It's a bit of the wild west at the moment with regards to reason for deprecated rank qualifiers. I'd suggest to be liberal with choosing a suitable item, even to create your own if necessary. I've been collecting some as instances of Wikibase reason for deprecated rank (Q27949697), a subclass of Wikidata internal entity (Q21281405) which contains other interesting stuff. There's two types of items used: the ones created especially/only for use with reason for deprecated rank (P2241) (such as not been able to confirm this claim (Q21655367)), which are the ones I've been marking. The second are items for concepts that can more or less double as a reason (such as ambiguity (Q1140419)) and whose use will (or won't) grow organically until maybe they are adopted as a standard. I've been considering marking those as well as instances of a yet-to-be-named subclass of Wikibase reason for deprecated rank (Q27949697) or Wikidata internal entity (Q21281405) (maybe \"concept used in Wikidata qualifier statements\"), but a query like yours may be a better way to look for them or collect them. --Azertus (talk) 13:13, 11 December 2016 (UTC) Thanks for commenting. This time I chose withdrawn identifier value (Q21441764) from the items already in use with this property, since this pretty much describes the situation: dead/invalid links in external-id statements. Getting these reason items managed properly by subclassing etc. sound like a good idea to me! —MisterSynergy (talk) 13:20, 11 December 2016 (UTC) Finding Wikidata IDs for a list of organisations I have a spreadsheet, with two columns: column A has the names of organisations, column B the URLs of their websites. What's the easiest way to get the relevant Wikidata IDs (if any - most should have them) in column C, and Wikidata labels, in English, labels in column D? Will Google Sheets do it? How? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 19:29, 10 December 2016 (UTC) Solved it, using Google Sheets, with the 'Wikipedia and Wikidata Tools' add-on. The formula is =WIKIDATAQID(XXX), where \"XXX\" is the cell holding the organisation name, which must match a Wikipedia article title exactly. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 21:14, 10 December 2016 (UTC) Hi Andy - name is not a good discriminator for organizations, you really should be checking at least country and possibly location as well, there are a lot of organizations with the same name in different places. ArthurPSmith (talk) 14:04, 12 December 2016 (UTC) This was a first pass; they were manually checked afterwards. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 16:26, 12 December 2016 (UTC) I have a similar question: how can I programmatically access an API to get a (list of) Wikidata URIs for a specified search term?

TommyG (talk) 16:43, 12 December 2016 (UTC) @TommyG: You can use catalog code (P528) with a catalog (P972) qualifier, like this. If there will be sufficient breeds to warrant it, I'll put a property proposal together for you; but as they only seem to recognise 332 (plus 11 provisionally), I doubt it.

Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 20:45, 12 December 2016 (UTC) Thanks, looks correct from a random selection of breeds I've checked. I wanted to try to use it for this, but it turns out the file naming of the source wasn't nearly as consistent as I first thought. I'll just settle for displaying the FCI # in the infobox for now. :-) TommyG (talk) 21:42, 12 December 2016 (UTC) This section was archived on a request by: XXXXX Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 17:39, 18 December 2016 (UTC) Redirecting from Wikidata items to sister projects Hello everybody!

Most of these entries are now misconverted by the infobox templates on the Russian wiki, though they used to show correct Old Style (Julian) and New Style (Gregorian) dates.So right now, if I enter a date and mark it as having a Julian calendar in the UI, is this truely a Julian date - and not just a tag to a Gregorian date that says \"show both Julian and Gregorian dates\", as it used to be in 2014?And what the hell is Q26932615 \"statement with mainsnak date marked as Julian that is more precise than 1 year\"?--DmitryKo (talk) 23:34, 17 December 2016 (UTC) Ah, never mind, found the explanation: Wikidata:Project chat/Archive/2015/07#calendar model screwup. So, quite a few posts here assumed that calendar model and the UI are seriously flawed, that bots are mistreating Julian dates and that calendar conversion is broken, but it still took a year to actually recognize these flaws and another year to fix the code? Oh well... --DmitryKo (talk) 00:30, 18 December 2016 (UTC) And you know what? The UI for calendar conversion is still broken. Assume I want to correct a Julian date that was entered using the previous data model (\"dates are always in proleptic Gregorian, and \"Julian\" only controls the display\". If I just roll the date 10 days back, the calendar mode automatically changes to Gregorian without any warning. When I click \"Change to Julian\", it doesn't really change the calendar mode stored with the data - it only sets the \"Set manually\" option and changes the item in te list of the available calendars! If you save your edit right now, it would be Julian day and month stored as a Grigorian date. You need to make one more step by actually entering something in the edit field - then the calendar mode does really change, and \"Change to Julian/Gregorian\" link starts working too. If I click \"Calendar\" - \"Set manually\" before I actually make changes to the date, then existing calendar mode is respected and calendar conversion does work too. But how am I supposed to know this? The date is already entered in Julian calendar - my expectation is that existing calendar mode would not automatically change when I make edits. Gregorian calendar was only adopted in 1917 for Russia - why the UI needs to force the Gregorian calendar on me then require non-obvious extra steps to change it back to Julian? Nah, it's too much hassle for fixing the problem than I didn't create. --DmitryKo (talk) 01:46, 18 December 2016 (UTC) If we only fixed problems that we ourselves created, then Wikidata would still be nothing but an undeveloped concept.

Hi,I am currently at the OGP Hackathon and I've been asked: \"There is a government in Central Europe that may have the possibility to publish government data to Wikidata, and the budget to do it (either by publishing a dump for us to reuse or even directly maintain it up to date on Wikidata through the API), which data do you think would be the most interesting or useful?\". I told him I would ask the community so, here I am :) What is your opinion on this? If you had 5 wishes, what would they be? -Ash Crow (talk) 17:21, 8 December 2016 (UTC) Hi, thanks for posting this; I'll make sure that a summary of the answers also gets transmitted to the OGD/LOD people at the Swiss government. --Beat Estermann (talk) 08:16, 13 December 2016 (UTC) Hi @Ash Crow:: Well, just some (personal) suggestions: (1) basic geographic name data (location of places, sites of interest, etc; if we don't have it yet). Solid local references (other than \"Geonames\") to any existing ones would be good as well. (2) country or culture specific library catalog metadata, (3) basic data on elected or high ranking public officials, (4) statistics: population statistics on any location (present or historic), a dataset like Q21644845 ;). Eventually we should be able to absorbe more statistics, but this might need more development. In some parts Wikipedia includes lots of these and eventually we should be able to provide this from Wikidata (5) anything country specific WikiProject Movies lacks ;) At first sight it might appear obscure, but I think well-maintained datasets like the Czech notable tree dataset can be of great interest. Things that need updates on a more regular basis than every year might need some additional thought on how to go about that. --- Jura 17:52, 8 December 2016 (UTC) All data about adminsitrative divisions (population, altitude, surface,...) and historic and current data about economy (debt, GDP,...) but calculated according to an international standard.

Just an answer a question: all this data will be under Creative Commons CC0 ? --ValterVB (talk) 08:48, 9 December 2016 (UTC) He said it would not be a problem. -Ash Crow (talk) 09:23, 9 December 2016 (UTC) General wishs: (1) Switch the general default for database license of government data from requiring citations of the data source to not requiring citation, so that Wikidata can import more data ::without licensing issues. (2) Generally make sure that databases uses their own ID to refer to items instead of simply using strings. (3) If there's money for the project, I think it would make a lot of sense if they don't just publish a dumb but directly submit the data to Wikidata. Specific wishes: (1) Historic population. That data is valuable for Wikipedia importing Wikidata data. (2) Historical data about life expectancy. If you be really nice if this data would be available at a highly granular level that more detailed than just the country level. (3) The European patent database - Names of patents, area of the patent, links to inventors and companies, direct link via an ID to the full patent on the official website. (4) The European trademark database - Names of patents, area of the patent, links to the trademark owners, direct link via an ID to the full patent on the official website. (5) Registers of lobbyists in Brussels and the individual EU states. Including links to the bills for which the lobbyists lobbied if such data is available. ChristianKl (talk) 22:20, 9 December 2016 (UTC) Hi @Ash Crow: Five example-oriented wishes: (1) All (former) heads of governments (2) All population data from the very beginning of the country to the latest (3) All universities in that country (4) All ministries (and ministers) of that country (perhaps organized as a cabinet) (5) All geographical divisions of that country The idea is that I'd expect high quality data since the data comes from the very authoritative source ;-) Fadirra (talk) 15:01, 12 December 2016 (UTC) LUA and the #coordinates-parser Anybody here who has had experience with Scribunto and the #Coordinates-parser? -- Innocent bystander (talk) 04:11, 12 December 2016 (UTC) Isn't it better to tell your problem directly?

There are no objections and - as I noted in each proposal - the IDs are in use on en.Wikipedia, in over a thousand articles for each. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 17:46, 12 December 2016 (UTC) There are no explicit objections but many queries about this being duplicative; there are also no statements of support, so \"no support\" seems quite accurate to me. ArthurPSmith (talk) 14:07, 13 December 2016 (UTC) The properties are not duplicative; either of each other nor any other property. Indeed, during the discussions I said \"They are used in different Wikipedia templates. They are described differently on the [Library of Congress] website. A structure can have both types of ID, which will have different values.\"; this was not rebutted. As proponent, I obviously support the creation of the properties. There is no policy requiring a quantitative level of support. Indeed, I said during one of the discussions \"There is no quantitative requirement for support for property creation; please feel free to cite a policy or RfC if you believe such a requirement exists\" and no response was forthcoming.

So far, I am aware of the work of Spinster and John Cummings (Wikidata:Data_Import_Guide) in this area. I've started to list case reports and links to instructions on WikiProject Cultural Heritage. My next step will consist in writing guidelines in view of the large-scale ingestion of data about heritage institutions, with the intention, of course, to improve guidelines at a more abstract level in the longer run in order to support all kinds of batch data ingestion.Thus, I would be thankful to anyone who can point me to previous work in this area: Are there any further how to's, guidelines, or case reports regarding batch ingestion of data into Wikidata?In a similar vein, if you could point me to any how to's or case reports regarding the use of Wikidata on Wikipedia (e.g. in infoboxes or lists) that would be useful as well in order to guide further activities in this area. E.g. in what areas is the use of Wikidata data in Infoboxes most advanced across different language versions of Wikipedia?--Beat Estermann (talk) 08:34, 13 December 2016 (UTC) What is missing in the current documentation is the use of help:sources as reference policy in order to create an uniform reference system (help:sources is not managing all possible cases and improvements has to be done in order to simplify the rules but a common system is necessary to provide an unique way to extract data). Then I would like to see a section about data preprocessing in order to avoid constraint violations. Before any huge importation a data comparison should be done with existing data in WD in order to detect constraint violation before the importation. When data importation can add thousands of new statements in some hours, we should not assume that manual curation of data is the solution to clean duplicates or wrong match between items and new data. Snipre (talk) 10:14, 13 December 2016 (UTC) @Snipre: What exactly needs to be improved on the Help:Sources page in your view? And could you elaborate a bit more about the aspect of constraint violations? I'm not sure whether I grasp that entirely. - Today, I've written some instructions for the preparation in view of batch data ingestion about heritage institutions. Please have a look. Is there anything that needs to be improved? - I was wondering whether we should standardize the way source databases / datasets are described on Wikidata. Maybe starting with the information contained in the overview table I created. If we want to move in the direction of semi-automatized data ingestion from external sources (e.g. ensuring regular updates), a standardized way for describing data sources would be helpful. - Has there any work be done in this direction? --Beat Estermann (talk) 18:00, 13 December 2016 (UTC) Mirit/Desa Mirit I have the suspicion that Mirit (Q10994291) and Mirit (Q25116070) refer to the same location, as \"desa\" means village in Indonesian.

Edoderoo (talk) 07:44, 14 December 2016 (UTC) New way to edit wikitext Summary: There's a new opt-in Beta Feature of a wikitext mode for the visual editor. Please go try it out. We in the Wikimedia Foundation's Editing department are responsible for making editing better for all our editors, new and experienced alike. We've been slowly improving the visual editor based on feedback, user tests, and feature requests. However, that doesn't work for all our user needs: whether you need to edit a wikitext talk page, create a template, or fix some broken reference syntax, sometimes you need to use wikitext, and many experienced editors prefer it. Consequently, we've planned a \"wikitext mode\" for the visual editor for a long time. It provides as much of the visual editor's features as possible, for those times that you need or want wikitext. It has the same user interface as the visual editor, including the same toolbar across the top with the same buttons. It provides access to the citoid service for formatting citations, integrated search options for inserting images, and the ability to add new templates in a simple dialog. Like in the visual editor, if you paste in formatted text copied from another page, then formatting (such as bolding) will automatically be converted into wikitext. All wikis now have access to this mode as a Beta Feature. When enabled, it replaces your existing wikitext editor everywhere. If you don't like it, you can reverse this at any time by turning off the Beta Feature in your preferences. We don't want to surprise anyone, so it's strictly an opt-in-only Beta Feature. It won't switch on automatically for anyone, even if you have previously checked the box to \"Automatically enable most beta features\". The new wikitext edit mode is based on the visual editor, so it requires JavaScript (as does the current wikitext editor). It doesn't work with gadgets that have only been designed for the older one (and vice versa), so some users will miss gadgets they find important. We're happy to work with gadget authors to help them update their code to work with both editors. We're not planning to get rid of the current main wikitext editor on desktop in the foreseeable future. We're also not going to remove the existing ability to edit plain wikitext without JavaScript. Finally, though it should go without saying, if you prefer to continue using the current wikitext editor, then you may so do. This is an early version, and we'd love to know what you think so we can make it better. Please leave feedback about the new mode on the feedback page. You may write comments in any language. Thank you.

I'll keep this in mind :-) --Magnus Manske (talk) 14:51, 15 December 2016 (UTC) Symbol definitions with math datatype I've posted this question here but maybe it should be announced wider. I don't think that laws and mathematical objects consist of (Property:527) some parametres. It's trigon which consists of hypotenuse (Q104962) and pair of cathetus (Q110812)'s, not Pythagorean theorem (Q11518). The symbols refer to formula which consists not only of the expression but also of the definitions. (Also, there are drawings (image (P18)) with some symbols, which maybe require definition too). The definitions must be put somehow into the qualifiers or formula datatype itself, but I can't imagine what the data structure for it should be. At least, as a temporal solution we should invent something other than Property:P527 to bolt onto Property:P2534. Ignatus (talk) 22:54, 10 December 2016 (UTC) @Ignatus: I was hoping for the new datatype to provide some way to link these but found it doesn't really help. Maybe a better way to link Q35875#P2534 to the statements at Q35875#P527 can be found (currently has part(s) (P527) with qualifier defining formula (P2534) which seems a misuse of that property). It would probably be an enumeration with the same values, but with different properties/qualifiers. Adding all as qualifiers on Q35875#P2534 wont work, as we can't have qualifiers on qualifiers. --- Jura 10:27, 12 December 2016 (UTC) We need defining formula (P2534) + has part(s) (P527) (P2534 with links to items). Who can help to do this? --Fractaler (talk) 11:05, 12 December 2016 (UTC) Currently, I don't think we can do much better than Q35875#P527 except by using two new dedicated properties. --- Jura 11:56, 12 December 2016 (UTC) Development team can help? --Fractaler (talk) 08:04, 13 December 2016 (UTC) We can make some extra math-type property like \"Related symbols\" with such qualifiers as \"relates to\" (item, e.g. catet), \"described parameter\" (property, e.g. length), \"symbolic tradition\" (item for different schools related to different corresponding values of P2541) etc., but I don't believe we'll have a universal way to make a good legend from all this without multilingual text descriptions at least.

I would actually either re-purpose the 2 ft/600 mm item as only a 2 ft item, or delete it entirely and create a new 2 ft gauge item. 2 ft = 609.6 mm ≠ 600 mm. FWIW, enwiki covers both gauges with one article, which may be the reason for the current setup. -happy5214 20:27, 17 December 2016 (UTC) Kurdish Traduction Hello, Someone could take a look here. Thanks in advance!--Ghybu (talk) 17:59, 18 December 2016 (UTC) Best way to link an item (e.g. manuscript) to a register/list of historically significant items I need to add statements to items in the Memory of the World Register (e.g. Diary of Anne Frank (Q6911) ) to indicate that they appear on the register.The only related properties seem to be those listed below, but none of them would be correct uses: member of (P463) - Only supposed to be for people. heritage designation (P1435) - Only for historical sites. part of (P361) - Items are inscribed onto the list, but not part of it, so this is not an option. has list (P2354) - Only for linking to the related Wikimedia list article, not for saying they are part of an official list. Does anyone know of a property which would be more appropriate to use?If not, should we create a new property for this? or modify the scope of one of the above properties to allow it to include this type of use?I would vote for expanding the scope of heritage designation (P1435), as many of the possible values are effectively registers/list (e.g. listed buildings in the UK).This will come up several more times just in the data I'm helping to import from UNESCO, so I'm sure it will apply to lots more similar lists & registers. Many thanks NavinoEvans (talk) 14:17, 18 December 2016 (UTC) The primary way would be to use a specific property for the register. If for some reason it would not be practical to create that, one could use a combination of a property and a qualifier. I have used catalog code (P528) with qualifier catalog (P972). – Susanna Ånäs (Susannaanas) (talk) 15:46, 18 December 2016 (UTC) That sounds like a good generic approach that works well in a lot of circumstances. However, the Memory of the World Register doesn't yet have any decent ID or code to use, and the 'names' of the items according the UNESCO data are quite inconsistent (can include bits of description, or different languages in brackets) - so probably not a good idea for this data set. Once UNESCO have their own ID system, I completely agree this would be better with it's own property. Even when there is an ID property though, I think we also need something like heritage designation (P1435) = Memory of the World Register (Q16024238) (or similar). This is how it is for World Heritage Sites and Listed buildings for example. It also is a more logical statement to put the start and end time qualifiers showing the period is was on the register. NavinoEvans (talk) 00:08, 19 December 2016 (UTC) OK, I agree. Do you think expanding is better, or a new one, considering also intangible cultural heritage status (P3259) exists? For the sake of consistency, it deserves it's own and can be expanded with the unique ID later. – Susanna Ånäs (Susannaanas) (talk) 16:20, 19 December 2016 (UTC) Merge Q13548416 to Q394431 I don't know my way around Wikidata too well, so I'm reluctant to try to do this myself for fear of breaking something, but Q13548416 (two entries, later-created, in June 2013) should be merged to Q394431 (seventeen entries, earlier-created in December 2012). Both data sets deal with articles on the given name Agnes (English). The two articles in Q13548416 are the Czech (Anežka) and Slovak (Anežka) counterparts. TJRC (talk) 20:39, 18 December 2016 (UTC) It looks like those two are separate things, even if they're talking about different language versions of the same last name.

If (and only if) one of those properties is present, an \"autofill\" link is added next to the \"remove\" link/button.Currently, it can only add the reference title, publication date and retrieved date. I am working on adding support for publisher / published in and other parts of the reference (not sure yet how to handle author). At this point, perhaps the script is already useful and welcome people to try / give feedback / report issues either here or User talk:Aude/citoid.js.To try the script, add importScript('User:Aude/citoid.js'); to your common.js (e.g. like what I have in User:Aude/common.js) Aude (talk) 03:32, 19 December 2016 (UTC) Not to detract from the good work done on this, but I'm confused. If we have a PID for the ref, why would we add other metadata, which can be fetched programmatically by anyone who wants it? And if such metadata is needed, why not have a bot fetch it? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 11:56, 19 December 2016 (UTC) I'm also not understanding the use case for this. My understanding is that the way of using journal articles in references is to create an item for the journal article and reference it with stated in (P248). The PubMed publication ID (P698) should be on the item for the article. Gstupp (talk) 17:29, 19 December 2016 (UTC) Thanks for the feedback. I have removed support for PubMed ID for now.

Slowking4 (talk) 02:20, 21 December 2016 (UTC) @Slowking, maybe I read it in a different way. The \"official\" template pulls WD data, and that WD data hits their blacklist in a secondary edit meaning that the page cannot be further edited. The easy solution for enWP is to revert the template and use manual data. It needs a fix, and it needs to be easy and sustainable, so it is quite pertinent for the wiki to know and to assist with solutions. In this case the people involved in that discussion all have advanced rights and good knowledge and I trust them to reach a sensible conclusion. So I don't see it as importing enWP drama. — billinghurst sDrewth 03:59, 21 December 2016 (UTC) yes, let them manage their blacklist. but we differ about the trust. given this history [3] Slowking4 (talk) 13:59, 21 December 2016 (UTC) Help pages Heading trimmed from \"Lack of implementation of help pages; so the implementation at sites is left to limited set of experts \" I truly cherish this project and the potential for it, and how it supports my work at my main project of English Wikisource. That said, it gives me some of the biggest <facepalm> moments.At this point of time there has been large effort in populating data; and making available a whole lot of tools to power and super power users to pull data. There seems to be little to no effort expended in helping users to implement data pulls at the wikis into articles, especially aimed at the general user, or the simple templater. It seems that things are caught up in the politics of Wikidata whereas the use and usability of Wikidata is stuck at a lower level, just left or forgotten.We have no evident (or at least readily findable/linked) help on {{#property}} nor the new {{#statements}}. The closest that we have is an example page at a test wiki which is simply linked above, from a phabricator ticket, and an external notice.For Wikidata it could be said \"You have built; they have come\". The issue is that the bridges are too high, too slippery; the pipelines are buried and there are no maps to where they lie for Joe WMFer to do his work. Others wander around inside ooing and ahhing, but then walk out into the light not being able to incorporate your vision with their reality.The site needs clear examples of how to use the #property/#statements. It needs examples of how you would configure their use eg. how #statements that return an image can be formatted.The site needs some examples of how to utilise Modules: Wikibase / Wikidata, and even looking to positively generate these and version control them, so other sites, especially the smaller sites can easily import/copy them and keep them up-to-date. Also keeping an eye on developments of these modules at the big wikis so features are brought back and a central copy is kept.The site needs some clear examples with how to update infobox templates. It needs guidance to other sites administrators on how to utilise Wikidata to make their sites shine!As a reasonably competent user, and maker of templates I simply find it hard. How to pull a label in a language, how to pull a wikilink, how to pull a badge. This sort of thing shouldn't need to be \"ask a developer\", it should clearly and neatly identified in Help pages here. — billinghurst sDrewth 03:52, 21 December 2016 (UTC) Agree, are you also offering to help out or is it time to create {{Sofixit}}? ;-) @Multichill: I believe that I try to be a helpful PITA. For the bits that I can contribute, that I will, though those bits are probably \"nanna-help\". It has to be more useful than ... AAAGGH! <Unanswered questions in IRC.> FFS <try again damn damn damn> Please could we do some help pages. At the same time I do do plenty around the wikis, and documenting help is not my most valuable strength. — billinghurst sDrewth 12:17, 21 December 2016 (UTC) Documentation tends to be the thing done last or not at all. How to turn this into something actionable? I'm willing to help. Multichill (talk) 10:52, 21 December 2016 (UTC) I both agree and would be willing to help as well; could a Wikidata:WikiProject Help pages be useful for coordination & discussion? —MisterSynergy (talk) 10:59, 21 December 2016 (UTC) Yes, though I think that it is more than help pages. It is also a means to propagate knowledge, and to be seen to lead on the use and management of Wikidata-related modules.
