 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 22:07, 27 February 2019 (UTC) In the last query above I think you can replace \".*ger.*\" with just \"ger\". If you want to include also names starting with \"Ger\", as well as McGervey (Q37018304), van Gerwen (Q24979677), Boyd-Gerny (Q56254802) and similar, then \"[Gg]er\" could be used. That will give 348 more hits. Also, note that not all family name (Q101352) objects have a native label (P1705) or transliteration or transcription (P2440) property, see query below. Examples are: Alsager (Q17712856), Agerre (Q16303555), Gerardi (Q21449914), and hundreds of other family name (Q101352) having labels containing \"ger\".

I tried a lot, however, most of the time I get errors. I might have some problems with the syntax. Maybe you can give me a hint?

 Try it! This should do it! Annotated to make the syntax a bit clearer - find items where the PMID matches your desired value, and there are linked authors, and those authors have ORCIDs. It'll return one line per author/ORCID (three in this case). Andrew Gray (talk) 17:00, 1 March 2019 (UTC) Equally, interesting to see the full set of authors, including those for whom we only have strings.

 Try it! A \"named subquery\" does the job here, without any limits. From my experience, \"named subqueries\" have better performance in most situations compared to \"sub-selects\", which is the technique you have tried. However, while \"sub-selects\" are part of SPARQL, \"named subqueries\" are not—they are an extension of the Blazegraph software which is running behind the Query Service. Btw. please note that the query counts \"best rank\" birth dates only (i.e. preferred rank dates only if preferred rank dates are available at all, otherwise normal rank dates only). —MisterSynergy (talk) 18:44, 2 March 2019 (UTC) @MisterSynergy: Yay! Perfect, thanks so much :) Hmmm, interesting results… Say, would there be a way to list all qualifiers on these DOB statements and display them too? ^_^ Got as far as below but I would not know how to get all qualifiers on one statement (and then group_concat-ing them as a list or something)… Jean-Fred (talk) 21:16, 2 March 2019 (UTC) SELECT ?item ?itemLabel (COUNT(?dob) AS ?cnt) ?qualifierpropertyLabel WITH {

 Try it! Not sure what you want to do here. P569 values are typically not used with qualifiers a lot to my experience. Without having such a query available, I would also think that GROUP_CONCATenation does not really make sense when all kinds of different qualifier data types are allowed. —MisterSynergy (talk) 21:43, 2 March 2019 (UTC) Hmmm, maybe I just assumed there would be a qualifier − I’m playing with date of death (P570) and qualifiers like person found to be alive (Q21124171) − so I assumed there would be more qualifiers clarifying the conflicting statements… but on second thoughts, I guess there’s not necessarily more to say than having ranks and sources.

(in turn, I was then going to extend the query to get the categories that these cats in turn are in, to get a sense of what sort of things they may be categories for).I think the logic is reasonable, but the query takes for ever (about 15 minutes). The problem, I think, might be that the page table (mw:Manual:Page_table) doesn't appear to have an index on the page_title field. At the moment I need this, because the pagelinks table gives me a name for each linked page, but I need to turn that into a page-id to use the categorylinks table to see what category it is in. But joining the page table for the file-description pages, which I need to look up these page-ids, seems to be very very slow. (For the effect of this join, compare quarry:query/33977 (without join: 2.17 seconds), compared to quarry:query/33979 (with join: 1137.23 seconds)). Any thoughts or suggestions? (Or am I going to have to give up the thought of getting everything from a nice clean SQL query, and instead have to just scrape it and/or write endless API calls?) Jheald (talk) 18:26, 4 March 2019 (UTC) FIXED. The page table has a multi-column index, keyed on (1) namespace (2) page title. So the namespace needs to be specified in the JOIN to use it. cf quarry:query/34008. Original query updated and is now fast. Jheald (talk) 11:23, 5 March 2019 (UTC) WDQS MWAPI approach BTW, not so endless: select ?title (count (?title) as ?count) {

 Try it! -- Luitzen (talk) 12:16, 5 March 2019 (UTC) @Luitzen: That's very neat. I've never properly explored the mwapi service - but I clearly should, because it's a powerful capability to be able to call on. But should I be concerned that the numbers from the WDQS MWAPI query don't appear to match those from the SQL query quarry:query/33981? Can we diagnose how and where the differences arise? Jheald (talk) 13:01, 5 March 2019 (UTC) Presumably, it's because ?title (the category name) isn't what we want to count -- we want to count distinct filenames. I'll see if I can work out how to get this. Jheald (talk) 13:07, 5 March 2019 (UTC) So I can extract the file titles, and explicitly count them, but this doesn't seem to help -- the numbers still don't match the full counts I get from quarry: select ?title (count(distinct ?file_title) as ?count) where {
    service wikibase:mwapi {

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 09:09, 7 March 2019 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: Oooh, interesting approach. That's thrown up all sorts of oddities to fix. Thanks! --Oravrattas (talk) 09:54, 7 March 2019 (UTC) @Oravrattas: You might also want to think about setting up a battery of petscans / listerias, such as I've done for Women In Red here, where the aim of the game is to ensure all en.wiki biography articles have a P31 and a P21. The core problem is graphed here ... every so often a bot creates propertyless items for tens of thousands of articles. The Listeria reports are particularly useful in so far as, once on your watchlist, you're alerted to new occurrences needing fixing. Petscans are more of a chore. I guess there are suitable election / politician / constituency categories that can be mined. --Tagishsimon (talk) 10:08, 7 March 2019 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: Yep, that's a very useful approach — there are a lot of Listeria pages for political data (to the extent that I have multiple different Watchlist URLs bookmarked, so that it's easier to see only certain types of updates at once). I haven't needed to do any of the 'missing P31' types before, though, so that's definitely an interesting idea. More generally, I haven't been doing much work specifically on elections until very recently, so there are currently only a couple of reports at Wikidata:WikiProject elections#Reports — feel free to contribute more! Mostly so far I've been concentrating on making sure everything has office contested (P541), country (P17), applies to jurisdiction (P1001), and a better subclass of public election (Q40231) (presidential election (Q858439), mayoral election (Q15280243), legislative election (Q2618461), etc), but the first pass has mainly been very broad brushstrokes to get them down from thousands to problem cases to the sorts of numbers that aren't completely overwhelming, and will work with these sorts of reports. I was hoping to be able to move on to looking for things like a office contested (P541) of President of the Republic (Q248577) or mayor (Q30185), rather than a jurisdiction-specific subclass (or at least a of (P642) qualifier), but it's probably a good idea to fix up some of these P31-less items first. --Oravrattas (talk) 10:49, 7 March 2019 (UTC) Ah, I've found another useful approach. Many of the election items with no instance of (P31) or subclass of (P279) do have a point in time (P585), and adding that to my original query brings it down within the time limits: SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE {
  ?item wdt:P585 ?when ;  rdfs:label ?itemLabel 
  FILTER(CONTAINS(LCASE(?itemLabel), \"election\"))
  FILTER((LANG(?itemLabel)) = \"en\") .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?item wdt:P31 [] }
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?item wdt:P279 [] }
}
 Try it! That currently finds almost 4500 items, so considerably more than the mwapi approach. But even once I fix those up, there'll presumably still be a lot more that don't have a point in time (P585) either, so that way will still be useful for finding more of those ones. --Oravrattas (talk) 12:34, 7 March 2019 (UTC) Part of the label Hello.

 Try it! Generally, you can use FILTER or MINUS to remove, but not both at the same time. Here, however, only FILTER is able to remove those rows from the results set which do (not) match a certain regular expression. —MisterSynergy (talk) 14:53, 2 March 2019 (UTC) Hey, thank you ! I suspected that it wasn't possible to use FILTER and MINUS in the same line and I was trying to use FILTER NOT EXISTS, without success.

 Try it! as « = false » hurts my eyes an alternative using the negation operator « ! », it makes a true expression false and vice versa. It’s usually useless in programming to test equality against a true or false value, when « regex » return value is already true or false and « filter » expects a true or false value. author TomT0m / talk page 14:29, 15 March 2019 (UTC) Ranking Hello,Is it possible to add and display a ranking nummer (1, 2, 3, etc.) on a result of a query?Example : #afficher le nombre d'éléments disposant de la propriété \"archivé par\" (P485) par institution

Conny (talk) 07:29, 12 March 2019 (UTC). w:pt:Lista de pessoas que viajaram no espaço I had created this List article in wikipedia PT that is being accused of not having references and enciclopedic interest, and threatened of deletion.One way of resolving the problem of references could be deliver the URL of the \"Mission of the austronaut\"/P450, in case that exists (in the last column, for instance). I tried to put the URL of the \"Mission of the austronaut\"/P450 in w:pt:Usuário:GualdimG/Testes/Listas/2Austron, to test, but I failed to achieve this goal. Is this possible to do, and, even better, put the URL inside [ ], and being seen only as one number, to not occupy a large space of the Table?Beside that, could be possible also put the date of the \"Mission of the austronaut\" (instead of the birth and death date) in one specif column, or beside the name of the Mission? I think this is more complicated because the data is not in the item of the austronaut, but in another item.Would you help me, in these two questions, if they are possible to do? Thank you, GualdimG (talk) 22:47, 10 March 2019 (UTC) @GualdimG: It is possible, but there are difficulties. Some playing at w:en:User:Tagishsimon/junk2. Main issue is that the rows are per Astronaut, but each astronaut may have any missions, which means many possible refs and many possible launch dates. In this version, for example, we don't seem to have any real control over the ordering of the dates. In this version I've added labels against the dates. I can probably concatenate the mission name (and make it a hyperlink), the date, and a reference, all in one columns. Probably. But I need to have a cup of tea before I attempt that sort of madness. --Tagishsimon (talk) 23:40, 10 March 2019 (UTC) In this version the concatenation of mission, date and ref is done, but a) we have lost (at least) 1 mission - not sure why yet, and b) we have no control over the ordering of the missions. --Tagishsimon (talk) 23:48, 10 March 2019 (UTC) We lost the North American X-15 mission because the query demands a date which we do not seem to have. So we could probably work around that, but I'll leave things as they are for now until you've had chance to comment. --Tagishsimon (talk) 00:11, 11 March 2019 (UTC) Hello @Tagishsimon:! Thank you, so much, by your answer and knowledge. I would prefer the first version, but unfortunately lack some people, namely de Soviets cosmonauts and at least the Brasilien austronaut, and the references are not working, in this case probably because in many \"Mission of the austronaut\"/P450 there is no reference loaded. The dates are not given properly because the Missions are not sorted in any order, nor even alphabetically, probably they are presented by the sequence they were inserted in Wikidata. So, mantaining the date of birth and sorted by this date could be the solution for now. Thank you, once more. Greetings, GualdimG (talk) 00:21, 11 March 2019 (UTC) Ah. @GualdimG: Houston, I think we have a problem. The URLs in the wikidata source are not working - e.g. check out those for https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q111240#P450 :( --Tagishsimon (talk) 00:30, 11 March 2019 (UTC) @Tagishsimon:! The URLs are not working in the query/table because they are not working in the wikidata item. I have a lot of work to do replacing the URLs of the \"Mission of the austronauts\" by one I know is working [5]. But why not all the austronauts appear? And I tried copy your query to w:pt:Usuário:GualdimG/Testes/Listas/3Austron and the result is \"No Template\". Thank you, once more. Greetings, GualdimG (talk) 06:06, 11 March 2019 (UTC) @GualdimG: Template fixed on 3Austron and missing astronauts found - they do not have references for their astronaut mission - so for now I have made their wikidata URL the reference... --Tagishsimon (talk) 08:38, 11 March 2019 (UTC) Ok @Tagishsimon:! Is much better. I had made some Refs at \"Mission\" and now they are appearing in the 3Austron. So I think is suitable to copy the updated query to the article, and going to take some time repeting the insert of Refs. Thank you, so much, for your help. Greetings, GualdimG (talk) 08:52, 11 March 2019 (UTC) @Tagishsimon:! I am sorry. I will put, one by one, the Ref at Mission, so, please remove the \"Wikidata item\" as the Reference. We will leave \"Mission\" without Ref if there isn´t any one. Please, make this change in the 3Austron. Thank you. Greetings, GualdimG (talk) 09:58, 11 March 2019 (UTC) @GualdimG: Okay, that's done. I'll maybe look in later and think about the astronauts who are not showing a mission ... that can probably be solved. As normal, you may spot errors I have not seen; if so, tell me about them. --Tagishsimon (talk) 12:01, 11 March 2019 (UTC) And that's probably solved now, although the code could do with a rewrite, since I've added all sorts of badly-named variables to deal with data gaps. With luck there are no logic errors, but who knows. --Tagishsimon (talk) 13:02, 11 March 2019 (UTC) @Tagishsimon:, I think now any flaw is due to the quality of the information at Wikidata.

 Try it! I've try the MIN MAX thing, without success. --Simon Villeneuve (talk) 11:33, 13 March 2019 (UTC) @Simon Villeneuve:It depends what you want out of the query, given whatever is causing the duplicate. I see, for instance, duplicates arising out of more than one website. You might use GROUP_CONCAT if you want both/all websites in a single cell on a single row; or you might use SAMPLE if you are happy to pick one at random. Or you could select which one you pick based on its language. By way of a worked example dealing with the sites issue: select distinct ?item ?itemLabel ?locatedLabel ?image ?coordo (GROUP_CONCAT(?site) as ?sites) WHERE {
  VALUES ?item {wd:Q1588452}
  ?item wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q7075 ;
        wdt:P17 wd:Q16 ;
        wdt:P131/wdt:P131* wd:Q176 ;
     optional {?item wdt:P131 ?located .}
     optional {?item wdt:P18 ?image .}
     optional {?item wdt:P625 ?coordo .}
     optional {?item wdt:P856 ?site .}
  service wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"fr\". }
} group by ?item ?itemLabel ?locatedLabel ?image ?coordo
 Try it! ... and you'll see that example was a complete FAIL, because ?locatedLabel is also causing a dupe. So we need to deal with that too. More difficult, because we cannot group_concat a value supplied by the wikibase:label service; we need to get the query to give it to us explicitly before we can group it. So... select distinct ?item ?itemLabel (group_concat(distinct ?locatedLabel;separator=\", \") as ?ll) ?image ?coordo (GROUP_CONCAT(distinct ?site;separator=\", \") as ?sites) WHERE {
  VALUES ?item {wd:Q1588452}
  ?item wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q7075 ;
        wdt:P17 wd:Q16 ;
        wdt:P131/wdt:P131* wd:Q176 ;
     optional {?item wdt:P131 ?located .
     ?located rdfs:label ?locatedLabel . filter(lang(?locatedLabel)=\"fr\")}
     optional {?item wdt:P18 ?image .}
     optional {?item wdt:P625 ?coordo .}
     optional {?item wdt:P856 ?site .}
  service wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"fr\". }
} group by ?item ?itemLabel ?image ?coordo
 Try it! The group_concat includes a DISTINCT, else we'd get two instances of each location / coord in the result cell ... a Cartesian product of the action of grouping what was previously 4 rows. And I've used a separator because why not. You can as easily try SAMPLE instead of group_concat to see what happens. And maybe try removing the rdfs:label line so that you can see the need to explicitly reference the ?locatedLabel rather than hoping that the wikibase:label service will work. hth --Tagishsimon (talk) 11:54, 13 March 2019 (UTC) Thank you (again) for your help. Honestly, I didn't understand much of what you said, but I think it will help me in my way of learning more of SPARQL. Simon Villeneuve (talk) 12:59, 13 March 2019 (UTC) Yup. Following the patterns maybe comes first. Understanding comes later. Quick reminder that this time last year, I was absolutely hopeless at SPARQL, had only the dimmest understanding. Now I'm slightly less hopeless, but still nowhere near, for instance, Luitzen's league. Keeping on doing queries, and taking queries apart to see how they work is the thing. --Tagishsimon (talk) 13:22, 13 March 2019 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: In manual mode, one can use labels generated by the label service in the same way as regular SPARQL variables (but the service still provides fallbacks): select distinct ?item ?itemLabel (group_concat(distinct ?locatedLabel; separator=\"; \") as ?ll)

 Try it! author TomT0m / talk page 11:35, 18 March 2019 (UTC)Hmm. With all due deference to your greater experience & knowledge, I'm still not buying that ... though I'm glad we now have the two different techniques on this page, since, for me, the larger purpose of this page is to facilitate SPARQL discussions so that people like me can learn more about this arcana. What I specifically don't like about your approach is A) the need to query twice for pq:518; B) splitting the population of ?where across two distinct BINDs which, for me, makes the reading of the logic more complex. For these reasons, I'm generally unconvinced that - comments and layout aside - the logic of your query makes it any more readable than mine. I'd opine that my query reads in a fairly simple way: A) we're filtering because we're interested only in these two cases, and then B) we're populating ?where based on this pattern - both single lines of code which encapsulate concepts split across multiple lines in your version. --Tagishsimon (talk) 12:08, 18 March 2019 (UTC) Hello there, thanks to the two of you, but AMM still not working in TomT0m's version, even when simplifying the query. I have to use everything (Q2165236) (SYD) because sometimes point in time (P585) is populated for a year (domestic passenger + international passenger) = (total passenger) ; see for instance Sydney Airport (Q17581) Again, thanks for your help ! Bouzinac (talk) 12:10, 18 March 2019 (UTC) @Bouzinac: I see a problem with using « rest of the world » : this is redundant with \" « whole » minus « australia » \" and it’s not stable, if you add later a statement for another destination this same year, the « rest of the world » statement become false. Better compute it by removing the other statements from the whole. My solution suffers from the same problem, it actually don’t work if there is no « date » qualifier, which is the case in your item. I don’t think it’s a good idea to make the query work if there is no « date » qualifier. author TomT0m / talk page 12:45, 18 March 2019 (UTC) I am deeply sorry : I was too focused on references that I didn't even notice the absence of year dates :/ Now corrected and query functions well. Sorry again! Bouzinac (talk) 13:08, 18 March 2019 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: I removed a useless filter in my query A) It’s true that I use two times « pq:P518 » but I’m not sure it’s a real problem unless it’s a performance issue. B) I find easier to create a variable that explicitly says « ok, we’re in this case », than to rely of « ok, so which variable should I check to see if we’re in this case ? ». But maybe you’re right and in this case it’s not really important :) Overall, maybe you’re right and your query is not that bad, I just had trouble to really understand it. But the real important point, I think, is to try to avoid by design to build such complex query by writing the model with this in mind. A pair of properties « number of passengers » / « destination » with a direct claim « airport : number of passengers : 1000 » for the total number « destination : Paris qualified by number of passengers : 500 » would have saved us the trouble and the explosion of useless complexity like « rest of the word » that arise from not really ideal qualifier/value combination as a « catch all » solution to enter any information … and the inflation in complexities of the query to exclude the values we don’t want (because of course, an addition of special value can break the existing query … we surely don’t want this). Better have a query that have nothing to exclude. author TomT0m / talk page 13:33, 18 March 2019 (UTC) Missing descriptions OR Labels for German OR english Hi all,Could you please extend my current query?The query searches for missing descriptions in german, but I would prefer to see items missing descriptions OR labels either in german OR english.
