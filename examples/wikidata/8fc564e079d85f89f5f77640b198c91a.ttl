 Try it! but beware there may be inaccuracies due different precisions of publication date (P577) (day, month or year).

T.Shafee(evo&evo) (talk) 09:43, 2 October 2020 (UTC) Checking consistency of values of P585, P580 and P582 User:Bouzinac wrote in section #Shortest and longest wars above: \"My goal of data quality has I'd have another query for you : the items having both start time (P580) end time (P582) point in time (P585), showing those that having point in time (P585) very much not between start time (P580) and end time (P582) ?\" I have considered how to do this, and have come to these requirements for a query: If P585 have precision day P580 and P582, if present, must have same value and precision day. If P585 have precision month P580 and P582, if present, must have values in the same month with precision month or higher. If P580 and P582 both have precision day, they must be different days. If P585 have precision year P580 and P582, if present, must have values in the same year with precision year or higher. If P580 and P582 both have precisions higher than year, they must be in different months. If P585 have precision decade P580 and P582, if present, must have values in the same decade with precision decade or higher. If P580 and P582 both have precisions higher than decade, they must be in different years. If P585 have precision century P580 and P582, if present, must have values in the same century with precision century or higher. If P580 and P582 both have precisions higher than century, they must be in different decades. If P585 have precision millenia P580 and P582, if present, must have values in the same millenia with precision millenia or higher. If P580 and P582 both have precisions higher than millenia, they must be in different centuries. Before I create these queries, I had like to ask for comments on the specific requirements. Do you agree, or can they be improved? --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 07:17, 2 October 2020 (UTC) Supposedly, one could adjust ranks based on the results of the queries. One just needs to bear in mind that conflicting dates can come from references providing conflicting information. --- Jura 07:25, 2 October 2020 (UTC) I'd like to show the use case that made me Wonder about dates : https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q1064335&oldid=1179975218#P585 The more I think about it, I finally start to think that if there is start time (P580) and end time (P582), then, there, in an absolute way of modelling, shouldn't be none point in time (P585) after all. If a war/country/long processus/relationship... has a beginning and an end, how come it has a simple point in time (P585) ? Bouzinac 💬●✒️●💛 08:34, 2 October 2020 (UTC) Maybe for wars it's less obvious why point in time (P585) can generally be sufficient. Check 37th Torino Film Festival (Q76087259) .. as many film festival editions, it just has the year in P585. Some editions have P580/P582, but is that really useful information for editions in the past? --- Jura 08:47, 2 October 2020 (UTC) In your example 37th Torino Film Festival (Q76087259) (that i've modified), beginning and end dates of a festival are obvious, more precise than date. And thus date should be removed. How would you sparql-query any event ocurred in 2019, be it with date=2019 or start-date>=2019>=end-date ? Bouzinac 💬●✒️●💛 08:54, 2 October 2020 (UTC) Well, unless you add start and end date to all other edition items (and keep adding them), I don't think deletion of P585 is an efficient approach. Reasonator would probably find it even without start/end date. --- Jura 09:01, 2 October 2020 (UTC) Oh .. it times-out even for not so recent years: https://reasonator.toolforge.org/?date=1780 --- Jura 09:11, 2 October 2020 (UTC) Je ne connais pas réasonator...C'est supposé faire quoi?

As a continuum of 'List of living birds with an article on...' request I made a few weeks ago, I've added the code (which works on cy) onto gawiki here, but the Wikidata list does not update manually or overnight with Listeria. Any help please? Llywelyn2000 (talk) 07:27, 18 September 2020 (UTC) @Llywelyn2000: \"Overnight\" might take a couple of days. Given what is displayed when one clicks \"manual update\", it's seems to be the issue with the number of items (Topic:Vsgnh3njiw3ej3cl). Either you try to reduce \"LIMIT 1000\" to (e.g.) \"LIMIT 200\" (running the query directly on query service gives some ca. 550) or you ask Magnus to look into it. --- Jura 09:51, 20 September 2020 (UTC) Thanks Jura. Just back from a week off wiki. The odd thing is that the list works on cywiki but not on gawiki - which has a smaller number of articles on birds (650). It would be wonderful if this tool could be developed further; I used it as an alternative to 'See also'. I've left Magnus a message. Thanks again!

 Try it! --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 12:21, 2 October 2020 (UTC) @Dipsacus fullonum: Thank you, it looks way better! I have two questions though: Is it possible not to leave out the identifiers, e.g. from the optimization example I need only what I see under Statements. Second, when I use the search box and type 'optimization', the first result is 'mathematical optimization', which I actually look for. How can I get this one instead of the (actually correct one) 'optimization'? Sorry if I'm too oriented to the UI, but I guess the results there also based on a SPARQL query only. @StoyanDim: The user interface may distinguish between statements and identifiers, but from a more technical point of view the identifiers are just a special type of statements. Anyway I can remove them from the results. Q24476018 is the only item with the label \"optimization\"@en, but Q141495 has it as an alias. That is the reason it is in the search. I can include aliases in the query: SELECT ?s ?sLabel ?property ?propertyLabel ?o ?oLabel
WHERE
{
  ?s rdfs:label | skos:altLabel \"optimization\"@en . # Look for both labels and aliases
  ?s ?p ?o .

All fish I tried to get all species of fish by going through the qualifiers of fish (Q152) instance of (P31) organisms known by a particular common name (Q55983715), but it happened to also return me lion (Q140), so I first thought there's an error, but it happens that lions are Tetrapoda (Q19159) and tetrapods are Sarcopterygii (Q160830). OK, so I added a qualifier to say to excluding (P1011) tetrapods.So far so good. What's a query that returns me all species of fish now, given this new addition? I thought select ?taxon {

It also includes both extant and extinct species, and I wonder how complete we are on these. The following filters get it down to 40,905: https://w.wiki/eQC CAS lists 35,613. The discrepancy could be explained by either not all species being listed as extinct in a way I check here, or by having still too many taxa connected from fish. --Denny (talk) 22:27, 29 September 2020 (UTC) @Denny: It's easier to use FishBase species ID (P938): SELECT ?taxonName WHERE {

 Try it! I'm probably heading in a poor direction & need help. fwiw, the dataset of interest right now has 0-3 P921 values, but, one day, will have instances having 4 or more P921s. Is there a solution is the presumption of 0-3 cases is made? (I appreciate I could group_concat, but I'm trying to avoid that route, preferring a one-value-per-cell output). thx. --Tagishsimon (talk) 22:04, 6 October 2020 (UTC) @Tagishsimon: I suggest using a subquery to order the P921 statements for each item: SELECT  ?item ?itemLabel

Tell me please, why must the subquery be OPTIONAL? If removed, the query times-out, but I don't apprehend why. thx. --Tagishsimon (talk) 01:35, 7 October 2020 (UTC) It is a trick to prevent reordering of the query by the optimizer. It cannot move anything from after an OPTIONAL expression to the front of it, as that would change the semantics of the query. It would work the same way to make it into a named subquery. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 06:34, 7 October 2020 (UTC) Things I learn.

Is it possible to do such a thing? Christian Ferrer (talk) 16:02, 8 October 2020 (UTC) @Christian Ferrer: It is possible.
