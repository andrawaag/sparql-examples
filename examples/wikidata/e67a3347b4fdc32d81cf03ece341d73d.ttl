 Try it! Elena Ferrante (Q368127) has no name in native language (P1559) statement. Query needs to make ?author wdt:P1559 ?authorlabel. optional (and fix the variable name in filter(lang(?authorlabel) = \"en\")). And, indeed, questionable whether limiting name in native language to EN values would work effectively for IT authors. lang=\"it\" might work a little better.

How can I add the name of the author? 137.204.150.19 12:29, 2 March 2022 (UTC) If you're unfamiliar with the WD user interface, maybe take the statements tour. Largely, the answer is, visit the item and add a statement. However for this author there is a question: does a pseudonymous writer name have a name in a native language? --Tagishsimon (talk) 12:55, 2 March 2022 (UTC) How to pass a list of QIDs to a secondary query I have a query as such SELECT ?art ?artLabel ?artDescription ?wdLabel ?ps_Label WITH {

 Try it! In my mental model, %select_art stores a list of QIDs.

 Try it! Unfortunately, when a person has multiple values for one of the properties being concatenated--like Ferid Murad--it duplicates the value of the other property. So Murad has \"Americans\" and \"Albanians\" properly displayed but two instances of \"United States of America\". What would be a better way to format my query to prevent this type of duplication?

 Try it! But if I now try to count how many rivers have particular counts of incoming links, I get batshit insane numbers - there's now one instance of a river with 648 incoming links. It doesn't seem to make any difference whether I (COUNT(?count_linked_items) ... or (COUNT(?river) ... or (COUNT(DISTINCT ?river) ..., which gives you further insight into my frail grip on aggregation.

I'm looking for the numbers on the tin: count of how many Scottish waterway items have n directClaims of which they are the object (i.e. how many have 1, 2, 3, &c directClaims). --Tagishsimon (talk) 19:11, 4 March 2022 (UTC) Maybe COUNT(DISTINCT ?item) is needed in the second query. /wdt:P279* tends to added duplicates. --- Jura 19:18, 4 March 2022 (UTC) Thanks, yes, that fixes it. The two queries were counting different things; the first, distinct items having directClaims, the second, directClaims (plus heaps of duplicate rows). All looking better sorted in this version, which I can amend to count items or claims, and in which duplicate rows are knocked on the head by an additional subquery.

 Try it! --Tagishsimon (talk) 19:44, 4 March 2022 (UTC) Maybe the main problem in this type of query is that /wdt:P279* or /wdt:P131* can take several paths and end up including the same item twice. This may not happen for simple trees, e.g. SELECT (COUNT(*) as ?count) { ?item wdt:P279* wd:Q181388 } SELECT DISTINCT ?item { ?item wdt:P279* wd:Q181388 } --- Jura 19:58, 4 March 2022 (UTC) Yup. I was getting a Cartesian product of river duplicates multiplied by the number of directClaims. I've tweaked the query one last time, above, to include waterways that have no items pointing at them. --Tagishsimon (talk) 20:07, 4 March 2022 (UTC) And for those following along at home, here's the same query as a bar chart; note the STR(?claims) mangling, necessary to get the bar chart visualisation thingie to do what's expected of it. #defaultView:BarChart
