 Try it! Note that in both queries a single person may be counted more than once if the person have multiple occupation (P106). Both queries give \"the number of scientists\" per occupation (P106) or field of work (P101) rather than a \"list of individual scientist\". The number of scientist in total is too big to make a list of individuals for all groups, but if you limit the selection to one or a few fields, it can be achieved without a timeout. Here is an example query listing the individual scientists sorted per field of work (P101) and sex or gender (P21) for the two field of work (P101) ecology (Q7150) and gender studies (Q1662673).

Moreover, I don't want the system to return the Identifiers.How to query and get the correct results? It would be no problem in itself to write that query, but I wont because it is certain to timeout. There are 397,685 items that are instance of river, even without including instance of subclasses of river. So there would be millions and millions of results if it was possible to run the query.

 Try it! --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 09:30, 2 May 2020 (UTC) way to search for surnames in labels? Because not every person has a family name (P734) statement, if I want to find everyone with one surname I have to search in labels. The basic query which I found for the purpose is (using the name Beaupre as example):SELECT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE { ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q5 . ?item rdfs:label ?itemLabel . FILTER(CONTAINS (?itemLabel, \"Beaupre\")) }This works but can only do it without timing out if I specify a very restricted set of items to search, such as everything with a certain external identifier; male (Q6581097) is still much too broad. Is there a way of searching all Q5 whatsoever? also, how would you write the string search to only find your match at the end of the label? Levana Taylor (talk) 13:34, 1 May 2020 (UTC) @Levana Taylor: To take the last question first: You can use the function STRENDS instead of CONTAINS to match at end of the label only. However there is no way of searching all labels of persons using the Query Service. There are millions of persons with even more millions of labels, so it is impossible to search all in 60 seconds (the limit for timeout) without restricting the set of items as you describe. You will have to use some other tools (I don't know any which can be used here but they could exit without me knowing them) or analyze a Wikidata database dump. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 14:44, 1 May 2020 (UTC) @Levana Taylor: I thought of a way to do almost do it: You can use Wikidata's MediaWiki API to search labels in a specific language, and do that from SPARQL code. Please wait while I make a query for that. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 15:00, 1 May 2020 (UTC) You still can use family name (P734) Items used: Beaupre (Q4877609)   Properties used: family name (P734)   , has part(s) (P527)   select ?item {

} Try it! but that’s not totally it as some human lacks structured datas about their names. Still there is about 2 million humans with a family name. author TomT0m / talk page 15:08, 1 May 2020 (UTC) @Levana Taylor: Well, entitysearch via MWAPI doesn't work because it is restricted to 50 results.

I guess I'll just have to plod through the regular search, distinguishing between human and non-human by hand ... Seems like there's an opportunity for someone to write a specialized tool here. I can't be the only one who's looking for a more sophisticated way of searching labels. Levana Taylor (talk) 04:17, 3 May 2020 (UTC) @Levana Taylor: The search text suggested by Jura will limit the search to items that have a statement instance of (P31)human (Q5) and no statements with family name (P734) or Roman cognomen (P2365). That kind of searching is explained at Help:Navigating Wikidata#Using the search box and in more detail at mw:Help:Extension:WikibaseCirrusSearch. If you search for \"Beaupre\" in Wikidata (using the search field at the top of any page) you get 673 results. The search string suggested by Jura gives 36 results which are all removed by the filter FILTER STRENDS(?itemLabel, \"Beaupre\") because the don't have a label ending with \"Beaupre\" (Most have the form \"Beaupré\" instead). --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 05:12, 3 May 2020 (UTC) The same with Search shows what it might find. .. BTW, you might want to use STRENDS(?itemLabel, \" Beaupre\") to avoid combinations with \"Beaupre\". --- Jura 08:39, 3 May 2020 (UTC) Oh, cool!

E.g., I would like to know the entity ID of the phrase \"leaf area index\" (this is the entry for it https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q446746) without specifying that it is an instance of unit of measure (because I do not know a specification like that for every possible item I will need to get the entity ID for).I am trying this, but get a timeout error: SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel

 Try it! Is it that the query is written wrong or it's just that the search space is too large? @Maxaalexeeva: The query is not written wrong (although CONTAINS would be a better function to use than REGEX when you search for a substring) but it is impossible search all the many labels in Wikidata this way without timeout. You can instead delegate the search to Wikidata's MediaWiki API which have all words in labels indexed and therefore can do the search much, much faster than the query engine. The query below do that. The MWAPI search will find \"leaf area index\" in both labels and aliases and is case insensitive. Therefore I also added your search to the query to limit the found results to only labels with lower case \"leaf area index\" as you did. SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel

Greetings ♥ --Mohammad Hijjawi (talk) 13:49, 12 May 2020 (UTC) Search to discover new items, not edited by a particular editor What I’d like to do is filter the entire contents of a museum catalog (National Maritime Museum, in this case) to show all the items I have not made a change to? Recently I reviewed all of the images, in turn, within a museum and made bespoke edits to the majority of the items by adding to or changing a category; or perhaps by making a more discrete change, to a field,; by adding to a description or altering a date, source, author or license. These changes were only occasionally made by hot cat, they were specific to the individual files. Of course, over time and while this task was being undertaken new images were and are being continuously uploaded to the museum’s categories. What I’d like to do is filter the entire contents of the museum to show all the items I have not made a change to? I'm guessing my name would appear in the history page list. What I would want to see once a search was run, would be the thumbnail images. Is that possible?

 Try it! But it only finds three items which you edited. I limited the request to get only 50 search results per API call (gsrlimit=50) in order not to exceed for limit for contributors which are 500, but that didn't help. There may be more limits to the prop=contributors request (https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?action=help&modules=query%2Bcontributors) but it do look fine when I look at the API calls separate (https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php?action=query&generator=search&gsrsearch=haswbstatement:P276=Q1199924&gsrlimit=50&prop=info%7Cpageprops%7Ccontributors&format=xml&pcexcludegroup=bot%7Csysop%7Crollbacker%7Ctranslationadmin&pclimit=max + the continuation calls). Did you edit more items with the statement location (P276) National Maritime Museum (Q1199924) than Ships Trading in the East (Q50921795), The snow Mary Ann (Q50879707) and Scene in Plymouth Sound in August 1815 Sub-Title: The 'Bellerophon' with Napoleon Aboard at Plymouth (26 July - 4 August 1815) (Q50867190)? If so, please give examples and I will look more into it. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 09:29, 12 May 2020 (UTC) Many thanks. That was interesting. I ran \"Try it\". and picked out some items at random. First: A Fresh Breeze in the Mediterranean (Q50858142); I have never made an edit to this item. I noticed I was taken to the wikidata page. but found no link there back to Commons? There were links to RMG (the museum) and ARTuk. Should we not include a link to commons, or did I miss it? All of the amples I looked at did not link back to commons. Second: The corvette HMS Rover (Q50858802); This item is not on commons. currently the museum shows it in their catalogue but has no picture of it to download. They have given a copy of it to ARTuk, so it could be downloaded, that way. My suspicion is that you have this record from scraping and that the image has never been on the RMG site just the record. ARTuk has exclusivity on the image, donated to it by the museum. Third: The Capture of the slaver Gabriel by HMS Acorn, 6 July 1841 (Q50868900). I have edited this. The report didn't indicate that I had. Fourth: Ships Trading in the East (Q50921795). I have edited this item and the report did indicate that I had. Fifth: Admiral Sir David Milne (1763-1845) (Q50866861). This man has five images. He as an individual is Q2755184. I located the image on commons after some detective work. Interesting. Q50866861 is not mentioned on the particular image commons page, and it's not in the hypertext edit page either. However there is a statement on the commons page which says: File usage on other wikis 'Wikidata:WikiProject sum of all paintings/Image suggestions/Institution and inventory number match'. I have never edited this page. Best regards, hope this of help. Broichmore (talk) 11:50, 12 May 2020 (UTC) @Broichmore: The query above have nothing to do with Commons. It lists Wikidata items, as I supposed that your request was about Wikidata Items. If it isn't, then please explain again what you requested in a more precise way. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 10:17, 13 May 2020 (UTC) @Dipsacus fullonum: Forgive the naive questions? The search gives us 3473 items each with a Q number, is that the total number of records displayed on the museum website? Each one given a Q record. Totally divorced away from what we have from the museum available on commons? So if we have an item on commons without a Q number, then I can get it from here? If that's the case when is it up to date too, and when will the museum site get scraped again for new entries? What frequency is it scraped? -Broichmore (talk) 17:51, 13 May 2020 (UTC) @Broichmore: I have no idea about what is on the museum's website. I have never visited the website and I have no plans of doing so. The result contains Wikidata items which have the statement location (P276) National Maritime Museum (Q1199924). I don't know anything about them beyond that, or if there are images on Commons or not, who created the items or when they did it etc. I can help with WDQS queries if you know what to query about, and nothing else. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 18:20, 13 May 2020 (UTC) Querying item with optional images and some info about the image I have this query: SELECT   ?item ?itemLabel ?image

One thing I'm realizing would be good to include are people who are / were a 'member of a sports team' in Florida. I couldn't figure out how to get location from a sports team (such as Miami Heat: Q169138) to make this happen. If you can add it, it would help include people like Dwyane Wade (famous Miami Heat player), who is currently excluded. I think you can use the location a sport team's home venue (home venue (P115)). I am not sure how much that will affect the running time of the query; it may or may not be possible to do it without timeout.

The variable ?name will never equal the string \"FFCC\", but will contain items expressed as IRIs like e.g. wd:Q534132. The items have labels (strings with language tags) and sitelinks where you can test for the value \"FFCC\". For instance a test for an English label will look like this: SELECT DISTINCT ?name ?nameLabel

Ahmadtalk 14:07, 16 May 2020 (UTC) @Ahmad252: In what language do you what the demonym? Your query has labels in Farsi (fa) but I can find no demonyms for countries in Farsi on Wikidata. No country items has demonym (P1549) values in Farsi, and no senses of Farsi lexemes has demonym of (P6271) values for countries. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 15:23, 16 May 2020 (UTC) PS. Well, I wasn't entirely correct. There are demonyms in Farsi for about 5 countries – but hardly enough for use for use in a query. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 16:06, 16 May 2020 (UTC) @Dipsacus fullonum: In Farsi (it's actually a part of a larger effort to add Farsi descriptions to items about movies, video games, TV series and some other works; I'm going to file a bot task request for that). To be honest, I only check the US (that has the Farsi demonym), but that's fine. I will add Farsi demonyms to countries (based on a query, I think there are 181 items that are an instance of a country, so it should be rather easy). Thank you.

It is somewhat faster if you use the normalized values (psn:) of the height which is always in meter as that saves a triple in the query. Besides it will also use data from mountains where the unnormalized height is given in foot. SELECT DISTINCT ?elevation ?item

  ?statement ps:P39 wd:Q4416090. 
  filter not exists { ?statement pq:P582 ?endtime.}
  ?person wdt:P856 ?official_website.
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }
}
 Try it! The P31 element means they have to be a real person (otherwise you get one fictional senator). Then it finds all P39 statements which have Q4416090 as the value (all Senators), and filters out any statement with an end time (only current Senators). However, a handful of Senators have end dates set in the future, so they get filtered out - but this isn't how current positions are normally modelled, even if we expect someone will be retiring. Might need fixing. Andrew Gray (talk) 15:33, 21 May 2020 (UTC) @Andrew Gray: It's perfect. Thank you very much! Add column related to living people to Wikidata:WikiProject Properties/Wikidata properties that may violate privacy The list for Wikidata properties that may violate privacy is great, but some of the numbers are a bit misleading because several properties listed there are widely used for organizations, and not so much for living people, for whom the privacy risk is most acute. Would anyone here be able to add a column that indicates the number of (probably) living people to whom each property is applied? The list of properties likely to be challenged has that feature and I tried to replicate that list, replacing property likely to be challenged (Q44597997) with property that may violate privacy (Q44601380), but that query times out... and creating a fresh query of such complexity is frankly beyond my capabilities. I think it would be cool if anyone who takes up this challenge would go ahead and just update the page directly. In any case, thanks for looking into this! Spinster 💬 10:59, 23 May 2020 (UTC) The simplest approach is probably to create a query for each property and place that on a separate listeria. The result can then be used elsewhere, see e.g. Wikidata:Statistics/count/human. --- Jura 11:08, 23 May 2020 (UTC) Same birth/death date Hi all!

 Try it! --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 14:42, 27 May 2020 (UTC) Thank you Dipsacus fullonum (talk • contribs • logs) but I'm somewhat confused. https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1419#P569 does not look to give same date between item and the query result? Bouzinac (talk) 15:53, 27 May 2020 (UTC) @Bouzinac: I have no explation for the different dates and have reported it at phab:T253771. Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 17:01, 27 May 2020 (UTC) @Bouzinac: The dates for Vespearian's date of birth on the item page uses the proleptic Julian calendar (Q1985786) calendar model, but are converted to proleptic Gregorian calendar (Q1985727) in the query result. That explains the difference according to phabicator. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 17:19, 27 May 2020 (UTC) How can I get all subclasses, sub-subclasses, sub-sub-subclasses etc. of an entity How can I find all subclasses, sub-subclasses, sub-sub-subclasses etc. of an entity, for example, https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q386724?
