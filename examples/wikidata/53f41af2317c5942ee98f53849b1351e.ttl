  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q79007. # Innerortsstraße

 Try it! The query currently returns sometimes 22/23, sometimes 30 entries, depening when and how often the query is executed, allthough the objects have not been changed inbetween. Although the objects actually have a commonscat-Property, so they should not be listed at all in the result set, i.e. the result set actually should be empty.For just one city (e.g. ?item wdt:P131 wd:Q61724. ) the query returns 2, 3 or 4 entries if the query is repeatedly executed.Could this be a caching problem? Why are entries with commonscat-properties listed, while they should be filtered out? A purge to some objects did not change anything Using Cache Busting ( SELECT ?item ?commonscat ?sitelink (MD5(CONCAT(STR(?item), STR(RAND()))) as ?random) WHERE { ) does not change anything. Replag currently shows no problems. Also see d:Wikidata:Project_chat#Query_shows_entries,_which_should_be_filter_out;_number_of_entries_in_result_set_changes_when_executed_repeatedlyThanks a lot! --M2k~dewiki (talk) 15:47, 2 November 2020 (UTC) wbgetentities unstable as of yesterday (03 Nov) I've been running batch jobs to build local datasets using the wbgetentities API for a while, after great advice to move away from SPARQL where possible.As of yesterday these API calls have become unstable. I'm adding retries into my code for now but sometimes it still fails after 3 retries with random wait between the retries, causing the whole job to crash.Is there any known reason for this instability? --Kdutia (talk) 10:46, 3 November 2020 (UTC) Do you have more details on the nature of the errors and when they happened? Thanks! (note that this question might be better answered in Wikidata:Contact_the_development_team as it does not relate directly to the query service nor search). DCausse (WMF) (talk) 10:50, 4 November 2020 (UTC) Hello @Kdutia:, thanks for reporting this issue. Is it still happening these days? Lea Lacroix (WMDE) (talk) 13:57, 9 November 2020 (UTC) Hi @DCausse (WMF): @Lea Lacroix (WMDE): I haven't run the batch process in a while but will be running it today or tomorrow, so will let you know. I was getting an HTTP 500 error before. Thanks! --Kdutia (talk) 11:05, 10 November 2020 (UTC) Faster way to query sparql with labels Hi, I need to run SPARQL at wikidata endpoint using query that has a few labels in it, label query is very slow and inefficient, such as this, to find journalist that are born in Chicago it takes about 29 seconds, I have many other query that also time out. Properties used: instance of (P31)   , occupation (P106)   SELECT DISTINCT ?ent ?wdtProperty ?val ?valLabel 
WHERE { VALUES ?label1 { rdfs:label skos:altLabel } ?val wdt:P31|wdt:P106 [ ?label1 'journalist'@en ]. 
VALUES ?label2 { rdfs:label skos:altLabel } ?ent ?label2 \"Chicago\"@en. 
VALUES ?labelB2 { rdfs:label skos:altLabel } ?wdProperty2 ?labelB2 \"place of birth\"@en; 
wikibase:directClaim ?wdtProperty2. 
?val ?wdtProperty2 ?ent . 
OPTIONAL { ?val rdfs:label ?valLabel FILTER(lang(?valLabel) = \"en\") } 
} LIMIT 10 Try it!I have already read the query optimization page on searching the label, using the example given, it's still very slow, the below query still takes 11 seconds to return result, it's not usable for real world application.  SELECT ?item ?label
WHERE
{
  SERVICE wikibase:mwapi
  {
    bd:serviceParam wikibase:endpoint \"www.wikidata.org\";
                    wikibase:api \"Generator\";
                    mwapi:generator \"search\";
                    mwapi:gsrsearch \"inlabel:Frankfurt\";
                    mwapi:gsrlimit \"max\".
    ?item wikibase:apiOutputItem mwapi:title.
  }
  ?item rdfs:label ?label.
  FILTER CONTAINS(?label, \"Frankfurt\")
} Try it!Then I found a toolforge tool that convert the name to Q id at https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/source/tool-name-to-q/repository/master/ it seems fast, so what I am thinking is using this method to convert all name to Q ID first then query the sparql using only Q id. is this the best solution ? What are the best practices ? I am developing a php application that will call the wikidata sparql endpoint at https://query.wikidata.org/sparql then return the result back to php application and display it to the browser. Hi. In the first query above you search for exact label and alias names. That isn't slow. The query is slow for other reasons (lots of triples with very many results in many variables you don't use for anything). The second query from Wikidata:SPARQL query service/query optimization#Searching labels searches labels which contains a certain word. That is a much harder thing to do fast. I don't know the tool you talk about but I suggest you just optimize the query. It can be much, much faster. You can ask for help at Wikidata:Request a query. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 14:56, 12 November 2020 (UTC) But never the less, it would be preferable to use place of birth (P19) directly instead of searching for a property with the label or alias \"place of birth\"@en. And note that the search for an item with the label or alias \"Chicago\"@en has 107 results. If you want all places of birth with a that name, that is the right things to do. If you instead want to find persons born in the biggest city of Illinois, USA, you should instead use Chicago (Q1297) in the query. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 15:17, 12 November 2020 (UTC) hi, but I don't know why this query to know the Barack obama date of birth, it will time out, I query the label separately, there are only 3 result for label of Barack Obama and 2 result for date of birth, so the result set is small. --Esia1688 (talk) 15:31, 12 November 2020 (UTC)  """@en;
