 Try it!—MisterSynergy (talk) 19:41, 1 June 2017 (UTC)Tnx! Steak (talk) 06:57, 2 June 2017 (UTC) A couple of problems I have the following query. SELECT ?game ?gameLabel ?enwiki ?devLabel ?publisherLabel ?date WHERE {
	?game wdt:P31 wd:Q7889;
	wdt:P136 wd:Q744038.
    OPTIONAL {
      ?enwiki schema:about ?game;
      schema:isPartOf <https://en.wikipedia.org/>
    }
#    OPTIONAL {
      ?game wdt:P178 ?dev.
      ?game wdt:P123 ?publisher.
      ?game wdt:P577 ?date.
#    }
 	SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }
} ORDER BY ASC (?date)
 Try it! Two questions: I have commented out the second \"OPTIONAL\" clause because it was messing up the output of the query service. Without doing so, instead of several columns the output is all in a single cell, and the \"devLabel\", \"publisherLabel\" and \"date\" values are missing. But I do *not* want to skip rows with no date, developer or publisher. Can this be fixed? I exported as CSV and imported into Excel and converted the URL strings to hyperlinks. When I click on the hyperlinks in Excel, I am being sent to the wrong page. For instance, I am being sent to \"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/Q1255124.json\" instead of \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1255124\". Can this be fixed? Thanks very much. SharkD (talk) 23:29, 26 May 2017 (UTC) With your first problem, the fix is to break up that OPTIONAL clause into three separate OPTIONAL clauses. As it is, the clause will only return results if the game has a developer, a publisher, and a publication date. If it lacks any one of these, the clause as a whole will fail and none of the properties will appear. Why the results appear all in one column is simply to do with the formatting of the table output: when there are too many columns to fit on the screen, it presents results with the field names listed on the left rather than each field with its own column. This shouldn't affect how the results appear in CSV or TSV downloads. As for your second problem, I'm baffled. MartinPoulter (talk) 13:56, 30 May 2017 (UTC) Thanks! The second problem was resolved by searching and replacing text in the URL like this: BIND(CONCAT(\"=hyperlink(\\\"\",replace(replace(STR(?game), \"entity\", \"wiki\"), \"http\", \"https\"),\"\\\")\") AS ?dataLink). SharkD (talk) 03:35, 3 June 2017 (UTC) Sort ordering within a group I have this script: SELECT

 Try it! Currently I sort the entire result set by `?dateYears`. But, can I also sort the `?dateYear` (no \"s\") values within each group? Will this require subqueries? I learned that you can use `ORDER BY` within `group_concat` in Microsoft TSQL, but I don't know if you can do this in SPARQL as well. Thanks. SharkD (talk) 03:47, 3 June 2017 (UTC) I think this is still an open question: Wikidata_talk:SPARQL_query_service/queries/Archive/2016#GROUP_CONCAT_and_ORDER_BY. --- Jura 04:14, 3 June 2017 (UTC) Ah, yes. I was wondering why it only happened some times. Is there a workaround? SharkD (talk) 04:41, 3 June 2017 (UTC) Detect \"unknown value\" and \"no value\" I have some optional fields in my script to retrieve the year a video game was published. OPTIONAL {

        }
 Try it! However, this does not work when the value of the item is \"unknown\" or \"no value\". How do I catch these two cases? Thanks. SharkD (talk) 01:05, 2 June 2017 (UTC) ?item wdt:P577 ?value . FILTER (isBlank(?value)) ?item p:P577/a wdno:P577 @SharkD: both were used in Items with novalue claims and Items with unknown value claims at Property talk:P577. d1g (talk) 02:01, 2 June 2017 (UTC) @D1gggg:: I should have been more clear. I don't want to filter these items out. I just want different text to show up if the items are: 1) blank, 2) unknown or 3) no value. Sorry. SharkD (talk) 02:20, 2 June 2017 (UTC) @SharkD: you could use BIND/variables and IF to achieve any custom logic. d1g (talk) 02:32, 2 June 2017 (UTC) SELECT ?prefix ?type ?value ?customText

And the relevant bits: deleted I am not getting anything other than empty strings however. SharkD (talk) 15:32, 2 June 2017 (UTC) Here is a more minimal case.

 Try it! However, when I adapt it to my larger main script, the query times out. Is there any way I can run the query past the timeout time? Thanks! SharkD (talk) 19:16, 2 June 2017 (UTC) @SharkD: it may change output if you place required sections after latest optional tinyurl.com/y9wdzwda - 100 results in 32 s. d1g (talk) 02:24, 3 June 2017 (UTC) I actually posted the wrong link in my last message. But I instead decided to ignore \"unknown value\" since it cannot be distinguished from a blank value, and the script is not timing out any longer. SharkD (talk) 03:41, 3 June 2017 (UTC) @SharkD: I don't understand why your last-1 query isn't functional. When you add a wd:Q913503, it will output \"unknown value\" Which information do you need beyond that? d1g (talk) 06:11, 3 June 2017 (UTC) @D1gggg: I am not sure what you mean. But here is my current query, which times out due to the three lines marked \"too slow\". SharkD (talk) 02:10, 4 June 2017 (UTC) @SharkD:, almost the same comments, your query is fine except: line 62: replace ?boogie with specific prefix, not arbitrary (?item p:P577/a wdno:P577 or ?item p:P577/rdf:type wdno:P577). I used arbitrary prefix only to demonstrate how it works. line 62-65: should be before every OPTIONAL block tinyurl.com/y7n3aajn 1865 Results in 23806 ms d1g (talk) 03:23, 4 June 2017 (UTC) @D1gggg: The `?dateYears` column is now missing from all of the results. Can this be fixed? SharkD (talk) 04:21, 4 June 2017 (UTC) @SharkD: it was using YEAR(?date), I missed that during move (order is actually matters) If we place code back it will return them except first one (Q4034255). ?dateYear is empty because ?date is optional. any other questions left unanswered? d1g (talk) 05:17, 4 June 2017 (UTC) Place what code back, to where? I can't understand just from your words. SharkD (talk) 06:03, 4 June 2017 (UTC) tinyurl.com/ybgxyzls right after OPTIONAL {?game wdt:P577 ?date} d1g (talk) 06:17, 4 June 2017 (UTC) @D1gggg: Ah, okay. Thanks! However, now the items with a blank date are missing. I think there should be ~2000 results per my previous tests, with ~150 of them having blank dates. SharkD (talk) 07:28, 4 June 2017 (UTC) Arbitrary break @SharkD: I not able to relate why we cannot use isBlank or how to use them all at once. narrowed questions down to tinyurl.com/y95fe5fw d1g (talk) 09:40, 4 June 2017 (UTC) @SharkD: I forgot to use COALESCE.

The inverse would also be a useful query I think. Steak (talk) 08:39, 3 June 2017 (UTC) situation with disambiguation page items is messy there is Wikidata:WikiProject Disambiguation pages; dealing with disambiguation page items isn’t easy, thus the aforementioned point is not surprising string comparisons in the query service are inefficient, thus timeouts show up even when you query for small sets “Wikimedia disambiguation page” is also often used as en-desc; it is more appropriate than the version with p nevertheless, try SELECT ?item ?itemDescription {

 Try it! --McSearch (talk) 17:56, 5 June 2017 (UTC) That is pretty close to what I am looking for. This is filtering on the label, I would like to filter on the actual sitelink, wiki_sitelink in this case (but cannot get it to work). Ainali (talk) 20:45, 5 June 2017 (UTC) It does filter on sitelink, name of ?sitelink_label is confusing but it's what you are looking for. ?wiki_sitelink is URI. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 06:13, 6 June 2017 (UTC) I am actually really looking for the URI's that ends with a question mark, not the labels of items. I am sorry I was not clear enough in my original request. Ainali (talk) 14:47, 6 June 2017 (UTC) You said you wanted sitelinks that end with a question mark which the query does show. If you searched for URIs ending with a ?, you would get no results. Just don't get confused by label mentioned in the query. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 15:11, 6 June 2017 (UTC) Yes, obviously I was confused since I am looking for URIs. But if there are no URIs ending with a question mark, then my problem is solved, thanks!

 Try it!Is en:List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 2017 in good shape? It seems doable to import from there, but if others already work to import this table to Wikidata, I don’t want to interfere… —MisterSynergy (talk) 12:17, 9 June 2017 (UTC)NB \"Start time: 2017\" will pick up anyone elected in a byelection earlier in 2017 (were there any who were't re-elected? Can't recall.) Also worth noting that member of (P463):[parliament] as a primary property is now deprecated; we're slowly working on moving this across to be a parliamentary term (P2937) qualifier on position held (P39) - see Wikidata:WikiProject British Politicians.

However, the other one was requested as an alternative as well, but it is not that simple to exclude former MPs in that way. —MisterSynergy (talk) 12:41, 9 June 2017 (UTC) I was adding results most of last night, but as I was using it as a chance to migrate all the old records from member of (P463) to position held (P39)s with relevant parliamentary term (P2937)s, it was fairly slow going, so I only got the first 100 or so results declared. Unfortunately most of the tools for bulk import don't handle adding a new P39 without interfering with existing ones, so short of writing a custom bot, I don't know of a way to automate this. (FWIW I've also been adding elected in (P2715) = 2017 United Kingdom general election (Q25052149) to them all, along with electoral district (P768), member of political party (P102), and votes received (P1111) (the last one strictly doesn't belong here, but unless/until we have individual election items for each constituency, it seemed more useful to capture it whilst it was to hand, and migrate it later if needed) --Oravrattas (talk) 18:06, 9 June 2017 (UTC) An import/migration will happen, but at the moment doing it by hand is safest. The \"member of\" properties can't automatically be added to P39, as Oravrattas says, because a lot of people have multiple different P39s due to representing different seats. It's going to be a long grind! Andrew Gray (talk) 20:18, 9 June 2017 (UTC)@Pigsonthewing, Andrew Gray: I adapted the query to the model proposed by Andrew. Not all new MPs are already updated, but this lists of new MPs already populates:SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?itemDescription ?website ?twitter ?image ?startTime ?endTime ?party ?election ?electoralDistrict ?replaces ?replacedBy {
  ?item p:P39 ?positionStatement .

 Try it!So someone is importing obviously. If you’d like to see all MPs of the new parliament, comment the two MINUS sections by adding a # to the beginning of the line (the query also tries to exclude MPs from former parliaments which still only have claims from the deprecated model using P463). —MisterSynergy (talk) 13:52, 9 June 2017 (UTC)@Pigsonthewing, MisterSynergy, Oravrattas:. Okay. It looks like all of yesterday's new MPs have the new parliamentary term set, but very few existing ones do. I've fixed all the ones that still use P463. This query gets a report of everyone who has the P2937 qualifier on P39 set (155 at time of writing) SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?itemDescription {
  ?item p:P39 ?positionStatement .

Or is there already somewhere such a list? I assume this is not new observation that label = alias does frequently occur and should be corrected by removing the redundant alias. Steak (talk) 09:19, 10 June 2017 (UTC) The problem is that if alias=label, is necessary check if the label is correct, a lot of time sitelink are added in item where already exist label in the same lang, but the label isn't update. The query must return also the sitelink of the wikiprojects in the same language. --ValterVB (talk) 11:27, 10 June 2017 (UTC) I am not saying that this can be done by bot.

In bonus: for visual understandability, is it possible to get a gradient of colours?Cdlt, VIGNERON (talk) 10:56, 11 June 2017 (UTC) Your way of getting century looks good, except that you should use CEIL() instead (ROUND(1650 / 100) = 16 but it's in the 17th century).

 Try it! But it goes TimeOut :( Is there a solution? (in WDQS or maybe with another tool).Cdlt, VIGNERON (talk) 09:10, 15 June 2017 (UTC) Yes, that's a huge lot of items... what I did in a similar scenario (for geographical items) was to query longitude-by-longitude to get the whole little by little, then I added up after doing a request for each longitude. Maybe you could similarly add a particular condition to limit the number of items a single request has to handle? Syced (talk) 09:40, 15 June 2017 (UTC) @Syced: Yes, I know. I tried on smaller subset (like country (P17) = France (Q142)) but I'm interested in the global result. Here I can't cut by coordinates as most items don't have coordinates, we can probably cut by languages but I'm not sure how. It's possible to filter in other ways but again not sure how, for instance : only take the top 10 languages? (I tried but failed to do this filter). Cdlt, VIGNERON (talk) 09:48, 15 June 2017 (UTC) A wild idea could be to cut by the 3 last digits of the QID (so, splitting to 1000 requests), but I am not sure whether it is doable or not in SPARQL. Syced (talk) 09:57, 15 June 2017 (UTC) You need to use SQL instead: USE wikidatawiki_p;

 Try it! If there is no match, there might either be no item about the person you are looking for, or the date of birth is not given, or the name string is given differently. —MisterSynergy (talk) 14:24, 16 June 2017 (UTC) This can be made much much faster by replacing ?item rdfs:label ?label . FILTER(STR(?label) = 'Thomas Müller') . with something like ?item rdfs:label \"Thomas Müller\"@en .. However that also restricts it to a particular language (in this case, \"en\"). Another much faster option is the new MediaWiki API integration (see https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikidata/2017-June/010832.html). I don't know much about it, but using that instead (e.g. this query) gives the same result in under a second.

I am doing this for thousands of records. Is there a way it can be done as a request similar to this api [1] or this [2] where you can make an http call and just get a json response or text response? Nikki, your query method with the new MediaWiki API integration is preferred due to the speed. But you mentioned, \"I'm not sure how to make it do a proper fulltext search\". By that do you mean searching for the name in some larger body of text? It matches on the entity name now, but this would be extended to something else? Update: I now see: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikidata_query_service/User_Manual#SPARQL_endpoint but I don't know how to convert the SPARQL query example you had given using the mediawiki api intergration into this format.

 Try it! If you do ?item wdt:P2046 ?area, you are just requesting the value as it is stored in the item. You get the same numerical value by doing ?item p:P2046 [ psv:P2046 [ wikibase:quantityAmount ?area ] ]. If you use the psn: prefix instead of psv:, you access the “normalized value”, which is square metre (Q25343) in case of areas. You then only need to divide by the factor 1000000 to make it numerically square kilometre (last table column).

 Try it! --TweetsFactsAndQueries (talk) 00:16, 26 June 2017 (UTC) Thanks! Q.Zanden questions? 09:47, 26 June 2017 (UTC) Looking up a set of external identifiers I have a set of external identifiers: Swedish minor urban area code (P776). Lets take the set \"S0101\", \"S0102\", \"S0103\" as an example. I would like to know which identifiers isn't present in Wikidata today. As a benchmark: In this example, I know that \"S0102\" does not exists. And how large sets can I look up without causing problems? -- Innocent bystander (talk) 13:42, 25 June 2017 (UTC) I'm ussually doing this batches by some 15-20 IDs, but it probably can be done in larger batches. But I do it with Python script, so it may be not so very user-friendly. Tipical query looks like this: SELECT ?ids ?item WHERE {
?item wdt:P776 ?ids .
values ?ids { \"S0101\" \"S0102\" \"S0103\" }
}
limit 100
 Try it! Or, if the number of Px uses isn't very very very large, then simply look up for all instances of particular property and then look up for value, that you need. --Edgars2007 (talk) 15:40, 25 June 2017 (UTC) In such cases I usually perform a query that outputs all identifiers that are stored in Wikidata; subsequently, I use short scripts (mostly php, meanwhile also python) with array union or diff methods to compare to a given set of identifiers to spot those which are either in one or both of the datasets. It should be possible to make a tool for all users with such functionality, but I don’t have time for that right now. —MisterSynergy (talk) 15:55, 25 June 2017 (UTC) @Edgars2007: I wasn't clear enough. What I look for is the parts of the set that isn't here. I have approximately 3000 identifiers for every year. It is S0102 I want to find, not S101 and S0103. -- Innocent bystander (talk) 16:59, 25 June 2017 (UTC) But if you see that S0101 and S0103 is included in output, but S0102 isn't, then I think it's clear, which ID isn't used :) But agree, that Jura's query is better and more usable for humans. As I said, I usually use such things in scripts. --Edgars2007 (talk) 07:12, 26 June 2017 (UTC) You could just invert it : SELECT ?ids 
WHERE
{
  values ?ids { \"S0101\" \"S0102\" \"S0103\" }
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?item wdt:P776 ?ids }
}
limit 100
 Try it! --- Jura 17:50, 25 June 2017 (UTC) ! -- Innocent bystander (talk) 18:14, 25 June 2017 (UTC) Just for curiosity: does this work with 3000 identifiers at once? —MisterSynergy (talk) 18:23, 25 June 2017 (UTC) > https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T125299 --- Jura 18:44, 25 June 2017 (UTC) I can confirm that I now had no problems with ~3200 identifiers. -- Innocent bystander (talk) 07:19, 26 June 2017 (UTC) Using GET, right? That is, via the standart way of doing things? --Edgars2007 (talk) 07:30, 26 June 2017 (UTC) I simply followed the link Jura1 gave me above and replaced the example-codes with a set I got from a csv-file. -- Innocent bystander (talk) 08:05, 26 June 2017 (UTC) Query Service seems to switch to POST automatically if the input is too big for GET. —MisterSynergy (talk) 08:23, 26 June 2017 (UTC) Cities listed by population density Can you give me a query that lists cities by their population density with the cities with the highest population density on the top?

 Try it! If you take look at the first line (Mar del Plata (Q52607)), you must agree the data is wrong. (700,000 people on 9-metre-wide square?) Matěj Suchánek (talk) 12:26, 22 June 2017 (UTC) @ChristianKl, Matěj Suchánek: Interesting question, nice query, but odd results. I stumbled upon strange edit behavior: [3] by Special:Contributions/186.139.233.48 [4] by Special:Contributions/130.79.243.34 [5] by Special:Contributions/JAustria [6] by Special:Contributions/200.110.53.22 [7] by Special:Contributions/TheRichic [8] by Special:Contributions/187.158.206.82 [9] by Special:Contributions/91.16.121.246 and so on… I do not think that this is classic vandalism. It appears that there is some Wikipedia template around somewhere that does not make use of the quantity unit (or, even better, the normalized value) and thus displays “wrong” values if the quantity unit isn’t square kilometre (Q712226). What to do? —MisterSynergy (talk) 13:02, 22 June 2017 (UTC) That's a good catch, MisterSynergy! It could be a Wikipedia template, most likely I think, but even a third-party use. I will try to find all similar changes and the cause of them. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 15:04, 22 June 2017 (UTC) I am unable to definitely spot the culprit, but I think it might be es:Plantilla:Ficha de entidad subnacional, which has just been changed today (see es:Wikipedia:Café/Archivo/Técnica/Actual#Ficha de entidad subnacional as well). But I am neither a template coder nor an es speaker… —MisterSynergy (talk) 15:27, 22 June 2017 (UTC) Thank you. Spanish users and readers are known for modifying our data heavily, this could be right. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 17:04, 22 June 2017 (UTC) Thanks for the query. The top results are indeed a bit odd. At the moment I would like to see the country of the city but my own attempt at changing the query produce out of memory errors. Is there a way to change the query to see the country? The opportunity to filter by country would also be nice.

 Try it! Matěj Suchánek (talk) 15:00, 22 June 2017 (UTC) The Query also finds historical cities, e.g. Altona (Q1630). Also, some cites like Frankfurt (Q1794) are listed more than once. Can somebody modify the query so that only current cities are found and listed only once? Steak (talk) 15:32, 22 June 2017 (UTC) Frankfurt (Q1794) has multiple preferred population (P1082) about population, that's why you can see it twice (I'd like to have the query as simple as possible). I updated the latest query above. Matěj Suchánek (talk) 17:03, 22 June 2017 (UTC) Thanks, for the latest query. Given that what happens to be a city can be a bit misleading (Paris is 4 times as dense as London), I switched to \"human settlement\". My query tinyurl.com/yawhhsxn works for Germany but when I want to look at the US it doesn't compute. If there a way to optimize the query, so that it computes for the US? Is there otherwise a way to only look at individual US states like California? ChristianKl (talk) 13:42, 27 June 2017 (UTC) How to format string output as clickable link? I cannot get the output of my query in the example below as \"clickable\" as I like. The WP sitelink and the \"official website\" are datatype URL anyway, so that's not a problem. But the Theatres Trust Database ID is a normal string property (like all those authority data properties are, by the way). I does, however, very much represent a defined part of an URL, and it would be nice to be able to generate something clickable. Here's as far as I got (and before you try it, adding the \"<\" and \">\" to the string doesn't help either). """@en;
