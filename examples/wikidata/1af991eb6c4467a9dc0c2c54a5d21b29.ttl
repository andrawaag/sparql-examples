Can this be replaced with something better? Above a query with the ca 1200 current uses. --- Jura 07:33, 20 June 2019 (UTC) I suggest to create a new Q-item that will be of the right type (catalog/gallary/whatever) that will replace these occurences. I understand the constraint, as it is a museum, and indeed not a publication of that museum. Replacing the items will then be a matter of writing a small script. Edoderoo (talk) 07:38, 20 June 2019 (UTC) Sounds good. --- Jura 07:54, 20 June 2019 (UTC) If you create a suitable catalog item, I could do this as I have such scripts available. --MisterSynergy (talk) 08:20, 20 June 2019 (UTC) Sure: Q64732761.

I could do this as well with one edit per item. Opinions? --MisterSynergy (talk) 11:59, 20 June 2019 (UTC) Agree. Forgot to mention that. --- Jura 12:03, 20 June 2019 (UTC) Okay; I am running another similar job first which I prepared three weeks ago (13.000 edits), and then this one will start... --MisterSynergy (talk) 12:27, 20 June 2019 (UTC) Finished --MisterSynergy (talk) 10:05, 21 June 2019 (UTC) Items used: CERL Thesaurus (Q60909659)   , Consortium of European Research Libraries (Q1127581)   Properties used: CERL Thesaurus ID (P1871)   , stated in (P248)   # New wd:Q60909659

Would you kindly update these too? --- Jura 10:57, 21 June 2019 (UTC) Sure, but it is probably worth to generalize, right? --MisterSynergy (talk) 12:54, 21 June 2019 (UTC) Yep. As we don't have a special qualifier for quaternary sources ;) --- Jura 13:13, 21 June 2019 (UTC) Finished again --MisterSynergy (talk) 17:53, 21 June 2019 (UTC) I think that this discussion is resolved and can be archived. If you disagree, don't hesitate to replace this template with your comment. MisterSynergy (talk) 17:53, 21 June 2019 (UTC) Change pq:P31 to pq:P3831 (for P1684) Qualifiers to fix: Properties used: inscription (P1684)   , object of statement has role (P3831)   , instance of (P31)   #new pq:P3831

 Try it! As P31 shouldn't be used as a qualifier and we have P3831 in the meantime, please replace the qualifier in the above. --- Jura 13:50, 21 June 2019 (UTC) Done  I think that this discussion is resolved and can be archived.

I think it make it easier to use them in quries or an infobox, e.g. at c:Category:Economy of Mauritania, c:Category:Economy of Andorra,I don't think any of these property values have multiple sources or multiple criteria that might justify having more than one preferred rank.@813gan, WDBot: who added some of the data, FYI. @Laboramus: whose bot sometimes changes such rank. --- Jura 15:14, 29 June 2019 (UTC)Good idea. I will add ability to set ranks to my code and correct these statments. Also, what data would you like to have in these infoboxes? --813gan (talk) 15:26, 30 June 2019 (UTC) Currently, I just added there what's available here. This way it is showcased at least somewhere. Once the rank set, it will only show the preferred value. Ideally, many from w:Template:Infobox economy would be available, though some might not be doable in Wikidata. --- Jura 20:39, 30 June 2019 (UTC) @813gan, Jura1: Hi there. The PreferentialBot has the job to set the preferred rank for values with the most actual point in time qualifier. If you want this, please post the values on the discussion site of the bot. Then the operator of the Bot will take the properties to serve them. Cheers! Datawiki30 (talk) 18:59, 1 July 2019 (UTC) It's Laboramus doing that in his spare time if he wants. I pinged him above, but other interested bot operators can do the same. --- Jura 19:01, 1 July 2019 (UTC) Sorry for delay. If there are any other data sets (with affordable license) that would be useful in these infoboxes let me know. --813gan (talk) 23:03, 10 July 2019 (UTC) Yep sorry has been a bit busy lately, but I will look into adding it asap. Laboramus (talk) 01:02, 19 July 2019 (UTC) This section was archived on a request by: Thanks Laboramus. --- Jura 20:55, 19 July 2019 (UTC) ResearcherID (P1053) was replaced by Publons author ID (P3829) Request date: 4 May 2019, by: Kolja21 Link to discussions justifying the request \"Web of Science ResearcherID is now on Publons.\" [1] Task description The ResearcherID (52.358 items outdated) should be replaced by Publons author ID: Monika Hestad (Q6900190), ResearcherID (P1053): K-8011-2013 → Publons author ID (P3829): 2601748 Discussion Request process Accepted by (Edoderoo (talk) 16:50, 10 June 2019 (UTC)) and under process Can you confirm that this is what you need? Anne H. Berman Richard Edwards If so, then I can run this script for all remaining items. @Edoderoo: Yes, both edits are correct. Thanks! --Kolja21 (talk) 22:54, 10 June 2019 (UTC) It's running, I guess until somewhere next weekend. Edoderoo (talk) 14:18, 12 June 2019 (UTC) Task completed (19:11, 14 June 2019 (UTC)) @Edoderoo: Thanks for your work! Two questions: The bot added Publons author ID (P3829) in some cases two times.[2] Can you check the edits? I already started a task to fix that. I believe it is caused by another issue on the server today, the lag for queries is pretty high today, and my script didn't expect to find entries already edited before. Edoderoo (talk) 20:26, 14 June 2019 (UTC) Do we still need ResearcherID (P1053) if it is replaced by Publons author ID (P3829)?

Kolja21 (talk) 02:51, 26 August 2019 (UTC) HDI set preferred rank When looking at the data for the previous request, it occurred to me that maybe the same as above should be done for Human Development Index (P1081) (most recent value should have preferred rank, all others normal rank). However, I don't use it myself and it's a different type of data. @IvanP: who seem to have worked with it. --- Jura 15:35, 29 June 2019 (UTC) @Jura1: I just wanted to note that HDI estimates for certain years have changed, e.g., the HDI of Germany in 1995 was given as 0.830 at the time I added the value to Wikidata, now it is 0.834. Bodhisattwa added current estimates but the outdated ones should be deleted. (I am not familiar with OpenRefine yet and actually did the HDI stuff manually back then. 😲) -- IvanP (talk) 16:33, 29 June 2019 (UTC) Items used: Mauritania (Q1025)   Properties used: Human Development Index (P1081)   , reference URL (P854)   , stated in (P248)   , point in time (P585)   """@en;
