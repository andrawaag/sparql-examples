(I thought descriptions should be in \"Sentence case\" but very often they also contain the exchange name)Please note that prepositions should be in lower case, eg \"BOLSA DE COMERCIO DE SANTA FE\" should be come \"Bolsa de Comercio de Santa Fe\". Licence of data to import (if relevant) Discussion The linked constraint page lists 10 items with all-caps labels and 10 items with all-caps descriptions. You should fix this small number by hand as writing a bot for this would take hours and the correct (automatic) handling of prepositions is difficult. --Pyfisch (talk) 10:14, 5 October 2020 (UTC) 10 is just a selection. There are many more. --- Jura 10:18, 14 October 2020 (UTC) The task is more difficult since there are many acronyms that must be left as is (eg APA, OTF, OTP, NASDAQ, STOXX, etc).

Also, the way the query is written doesn't show the full extent of the problem. If a University has 1 claim with year and 100 without year, you won't count it --Vladimir Alexiev (talk) 02:55, 11 December 2020 (UTC) I'm not sure about a possible source.

I think the proportion of people there who are not really notable would be at least 50%. That isn't a definitive argument, but I regard having to sift through numerous country vicars to do a disambiguation run as fairly undesirable. It would be rather better to have them in mix'n'match by some device. That would correspond to what has gone in with Cambridge alumni. Charles Matthews (talk) 19:39, 9 December 2020 (UTC) I tried to find a way to use Mix'n'match for Wikisource entries, but people seemed to think that it's not desirable. Maybe some filtering should be done beforehand, but it shouldn't be too complex to identify duplicates based on YOB and name once the items created. --- Jura 19:44, 9 December 2020 (UTC) Maybe ORCID is the better comparison in terms of notability. --- Jura 13:30, 18 December 2020 (UTC) Add info about subject to items with generic title \"obituary\" Items used: scholarly article (Q13442814)   Properties used: instance of (P31)   , main subject (P921)   , published in (P1433)   SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel ?itemDescription ?pubvenueLabel
