 Try it! These are the ones Wikidata knows about. Enjoy. --Infrastruktur (T | C) 00:08, 1 December 2021 (UTC) Minor issue regarding Humans per DoD query Hi, @Quesotiotyo: has helped me tremendously creating a query that I'm using as we speak (context). However, there seems to be a small issue regarding persons of which multiple death dates exist in Wikidata. For instance: Evelyn Laye has two DoD's connected to her. Therefore she shows up in the query results with both DoD-parameter \"+1996-02-16\" and \"+1996-02-17\". This is what we want. However, regarding Robert Kühner this does not happen: connected DoD's to him are '27 February 1996' and '28 February 1996' but Robert does not show up in the results with DoD-parameter \"+1996-02-27\". Does someone know what's going on? Regards, Mill 1 (talk) 17:07, 28 November 2021 (UTC) SELECT

 Try it! The query is for the best ranked date of death. Robert Kühner (Q2226482) has two values for date of death (P570). One is normal rank, and one is preferred rank, so the query will only show the date with preferred rank. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 18:36, 28 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, thanks for clearing that up. Where can I find the data on 'normal/preferred ranked' for this date of death (P570)? Having trouble locating it in the item Robert Kühner (Q2226482). Mill 1 (talk) 18:52, 28 November 2021 (UTC) @Mill 1: When you go to Q2226482#P570 you can see 3 figures immediately to the left of each date. If the top figure is completely filled in, the value has preferred rank. If the middle figure is completely filled in, the value has normal rank. And if the bottom figure is filled in, the value has deprecated rank. You can read more about ranking at Help:Ranking. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 14:10, 2 December 2021 (UTC) @Dipsacus fullonum: Thank you clearing that up. I never would've guessed!

} Try it! Gets you a chart comparing QIDs to milestones in item creation. It suggests that items without claims with a sitelink to dewiki are either very old or recent. --- Jura 15:03, 29 November 2021 (UTC)\"It suggests that items without claims with a sitelink to dewiki are either very old or recent.\" YES, you are right. It is because I am working on these item and started at item numbers < 105000000. Now I reached number around 1500000.Your proposal is a nice presentation but is not a solution for my problem. How can I restrict the query?--Fidoez (talk) 16:43, 29 November 2021 (UTC) SELECT * 
{
   ?item wikibase:statements 0 .
   FILTER( REGEX(str(?item), \"^http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q109\\\\d{6}\") ) 
}
LIMIT 100Try it! I don't think there is other than comparing with a qid you are already using. The filter above might be slightly quicker. --- Jura 17:36, 29 November 2021 (UTC)OK, so far thanks for the comments related to QID.But do you have any idea for schema:dateModified? --Fidoez (talk) 20:10, 29 November 2021 (UTC) If you are looking for very new pages, you might get a query to work that checks first only recently modified pages (and then for QID) --- Jura 20:22, 29 November 2021 (UTC) @Fidoez: The creation date for items is not stored in WDQS. You can access it by making an MWAPI call to www.wikidata.org, but that is only feasible for small groups of already selected items, not for a general search. As pointed out the QID number is ordered by creation date (but beware that merges can disturb the picture), but they AFAIK are not accessible indexed for searching in WDQS, so a FILTER using the numeric value is slow. --Dipsacus fullonum (talk) 15:32, 2 December 2021 (UTC) List of German Research Foundation Applicants (with GEPRIS Historisch-ID) (1920 - 1945) with living descendents I'd like to have a list of living descentants of applicants in the GEPRIS Historisch Database (compare GEPRIS Historisch person ID (P9044)). It would also be nice to have a genealogy graph of this cases. Nice to have would also be a network of all applicants with kinship ties to each other.
